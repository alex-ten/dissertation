	abstract = {The ability to recognize one’s own successful cognitive processing, in e.g., perceptual or memory tasks, is often referred to as metacognition. How should we quantitatively measure such ability? Here we focus on a class of measures that assess the correspondence between trial-by-trial accuracy and one’s own conﬁdence. In general, for healthy subjects endowed with metacognitive sensitivity, when one is conﬁdent, one is more likely to be correct. Thus, the degree of association between accuracy and conﬁdence can be taken as a quantitative measure of metacognition. However, many studies use a statistical correlation coefﬁcient (e.g., Pearson’s r) or its variant to assess this degree of association, and such measures are susceptible to undesirable inﬂuences from factors such as response biases. Here we review other measures based on signal detection theory and receiver operating characteristics (ROC) analysis that are “bias free,” and relate these quantities to the calibration and discrimination measures developed in the probability estimation literature. We go on to distinguish between the related concepts of metacognitive bias (a difference in subjective conﬁdence despite basic task performance remaining constant), metacognitive sensitivity (how good one is at distinguishing between one’s own correct and incorrect judgments) and metacognitive efﬁciency (a subject’s level of metacognitive sensitivity given a certain level of task performance). Finally, we discuss how these three concepts pose interesting questions for the study of metacognition and conscious awareness.},

In contrast to the widely held view that less processing reduces accuracy, the study of heuristics shows that less information, computation, and time can in fact improve accuracy. We review the major progress made so far: (a) the discovery of less-is-more effects; (b) the study of the ecological rationality of heuristics, which examines in which environments a given strategy succeeds or fails, and why; (c) an advancement from vague labels to computational models of heuristics; (d) the development of a systematic theory of heuristics that identifies their building blocks and the evolved capacities they exploit, and views the cognitive system as relying on an "adaptive toolbox;" and (e) the development of an empirical methodology that accounts for individual differences, conducts competitive tests, and has provided evidence for people's adaptive use of heuristics. Homo heuristicus has a biased mind and ignores part of the available information, yet a biased mind can handle uncertainty more efficiently and robustly than an unbiased mind relying on more resource-intensive and general-purpose processing strategies.},

	abstract = {Among the most influential models in contemporary behavioral science, self-determination theory (SDT) offers a broad framework for understanding the factors that promote human motivation and psychological flourishing. In this authoritative work, SDT co-founders Richard M. Ryan and Edward L. Deci systematically review the theory's conceptual underpinnings, empirical evidence base, and practical applications across the lifespan. Ryan and Deci demonstrate that supporting people's basic needs for competence, relatedness, and autonomy is critically important for virtually all aspects of individual and societal functioning. Beginning with theoretical foundations, the volume explores how SDT was developed and how it diverges from other major approaches to human motivation and self-regulation. Areas of common ground are identified, as well. Chapters describe SDT's six mini-theories and what they postulate about intrinsic motivation, internalization, individual differences, basic needs, goals and aspirations, and close relationships. Applying SDT to child and adolescent social development, chapters examine the impact of different parenting and educational practices, and take a fresh look at processes of identity formation and developmental psychopathology. Synthesizing a vast body of research, the book delves into implications for health care, psychotherapy, sport, and the workplace, including discussions of exemplary SDT-informed practices. Rounding out the volume, the thought-provoking concluding section focuses on pervasive social influences on motivation and well-being, such as cultural norms and political and economic systems. The most comprehensive, definitive statement of SDT, this volume belongs on the desks of all researchers and students in social and personality psychology, and will also be of strong interest to developmental, clinical, educational, health, and organizational psychologists.

This theory states that psychological procedures, whatever their form, alter the level and strength of self-efficacy. It is hypothesized that expectations of personal efficacy determine whether coping behavior will be initiated, how much effort will be expended, and how long it will be sustained in the face of obstacles and aversive experiences. Persistence in activities that are subjectively threatening but in fact relatively safe produces, through experiences of mastery, further enhancement of self-efficacy and corresponding reductions in defensive behavior. In the proposed model, expectations of personal efficacy are derived from 4 principal sources of information: performance accomplishments, vicarious experience, verbal persuasion, and physiological states. Factors influencing the cognitive processing of efficacy information arise from enactive, vicarious, exhortative, and emotive sources. The differential power of diverse therapeutic procedures is analyzed in terms of the postulated cognitive mechanism of operation. Findings are reported from microanalyses of enactive, vicarious, and emotive modes of treatment that support the hypothesized relationship between perceived self-efficacy and behavioral changes.

Beliefs are a certain kind of propositional attitudes. They express our attitude towards propositions about the state of affairs. A belief in a proposition is an entertainment (a consideration) of a proposition. Assent to a belief is a commitment to it -- i.e., asserting that a belief is true.
Truth of a proposition is unknown prior to its adoption. Thus, believing a proposition to be true requires some sort of a deliberation and consideration of evidence.
Knowledge is a justified true belief.
Knowledge formation and belief adoption are similar. However, knowledge requires rigorous justification because knowledge is required to be true. Beliefs can be held privately and be adopted to guide action even when their truth is not established.
Uncertainty is the lack of knowledge.},

	shorttitle = {The {Concept} of {Competence}},
	abstract = {During the 1950s, psychology was still focused primarily on drives such as hunger and sex as the energizing basis for all motivated behaviors. White (1959) argued, however, that a set of phenomena had been identified with humans, as well as with rats and monkeys, that vitiate this claim. Specifically, people and other animals were observed engaging in behaviors such as play and exploration that did not appear to reduce drives; indeed, they appeared to induce them. White thus proposed a new type of motivation that would supplement the drives as an energizing force. Maintaining that it is implicit in the natural tendency to master people's internal and external environments, White named it "effectance motivation" and posited that its effective functioning is the basis for healthy development. White's description of effectance motivation fit the definition of a "need for competence" (Deci \& Ryan, 1980), although he refrained from using that term. deCharms (1968), in discussing this new type of motivation, emphasized that people strive to master their environment and thus to feel like causal agents. In making this statement, deCharms was emphasizing what has come to be called the "need for autonomy or self-determination" as an important motivational force. The idea of fundamental psychological needs for competence and self-determination (Deci \& Ryan, 1980) proved useful in interpreting the results of experiments on intrinsic motivation. For example, social-contextual conditions, such as optimal challenge and positive feedback, tended to enhance intrinsic motivation by promoting perceived competence. Similarly, rewards tended to decrease intrinsic motivation, and choice tended to enhance it, because the former left people feeling controlled, while the latter left them feeling more autonomous. Research on the internalization of extrinsic motivation made clear that, while satisfaction of the needs for competence and autonomy are important for internalization, the basic need for relatedness is also critical for this process. In part, people are inclined to internalize the behaviors and values in their social environment in order to feel both a sense of belonging within that environment and a sense of competence and autonomy. Thus, the concept of the three basic psychological needs proved essential for integrating research results related to both intrinsic and extrinsic motivation. Subsequent research has been more directly concerned with providing evidence that the new type of motivation is indeed based in psychological needs.

Beyond choosing an appropriate action, making good decisions entails the ability to choose the relevant information, but fundamental questions remain about the brain’s information sampling policies. Recent studies described the neural correlates of seeking information about a reward, but it remains unknown whether, and how, neurons encode choices of instrumental information, in contexts in which the information guides subsequent actions. Here we show that parietal cortical neurons involved in oculomotor decisions encode, before an information sampling saccade, the reduction in uncertainty that the saccade is expected to bring for a subsequent action. These responses were distinct from the neurons’ visual and saccadic modulations and from signals of expected reward or reward prediction errors. Therefore, even in an instrumental context when information and reward gains are closely correlated, individual cells encode decision variables that are based on informational factors and can guide the active sampling of action-relevant cues.},

This function is especially critical when task states include unobservable information, for instance, from working memory. We use this framework to explain classic ﬁndings in reversal learning, delayed alternation, extinction, and devaluation as well as more recent ﬁndings showing the effect of OFC lesions on the ﬁring of dopaminergic neurons in ventral tegmental area (VTA) in rodents performing an RL task. In addition, we generate a number of testable experimental predictions that can distinguish our theory from other accounts of OFC function.},

We call our measure meta-d0, which reﬂects how much information, in signal-to-noise units, is available for metacognition. Applying this novel method in a 2interval forced choice visual task, we found that subjects’ metacognitive sensitivity was close to, but signiﬁcantly below, optimality.

Despite the importance of curiosity and related behaviors, the topic has been largely neglected in human neuroscience; hence little is known about the neurobiological mechanisms underlying curiosity. We used functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to investigate what happens in our brain during the induction and subsequent relief of perceptual curiosity. Our core ﬁndings were that (1) the induction of perceptual curiosity, through the presentation of ambiguous visual input, activated the anterior insula and anterior cingulate cortex (ACC), brain regions sensitive to conﬂict and arousal; (2) the relief of perceptual curiosity, through visual disambiguation, activated regions of the striatum that have been related to reward processing; and (3) the relief of perceptual curiosity was associated with hippocampal activation and enhanced incidental memory. These ﬁndings provide the ﬁrst demonstration of the neural basis of human perceptual curiosity. Our results provide neurobiological support for a classic psychological theory of curiosity, which holds that curiosity is an aversive condition of increased arousal whose termination is rewarding and facilitates memory.},

	abstract = {Reinforcement learning (RL) is a powerful technique to train an agent to perform a task; however, an agent that is trained using RL is only capable of achieving the single task that is speciﬁed via its reward function. Such an approach does not scale well to settings in which an agent needs to perform a diverse set of tasks, such as navigating to varying positions in a room or moving objects to varying locations. Instead, we propose a method that allows an agent to automatically discover the range of tasks that it is capable of performing in its environment. We use a generator network to propose tasks for the agent to try to accomplish, each task being speciﬁed as reaching a certain parametrized subset of the state-space. The generator network is optimized using adversarial training to produce tasks that are always at the appropriate level of difﬁculty for the agent, thus automatically producing a curriculum. We show that, by using this framework, an agent can efﬁciently and automatically learn to perform a wide set of tasks without requiring any prior knowledge of its environment, even when only sparse rewards are available.

          Classic reinforcement learning (RL) theories cannot explain human behavior in response to changes in the environment or in the absence of external reward. Here, we design a deep sequential decision-making paradigm with sparse reward and abrupt environmental changes. To explain the behavior of human participants in these environments, we show that RL theories need to include surprise and novelty, each with a distinct role. While novelty drives exploration before the first encounter of a reward, surprise increases the rate of learning of a world-model as well as of model-free action-values. Even though the world-model is available for model-based RL, we find that human decisions are dominated by model-free action choices. The world-model is only marginally used for planning but is important to detect surprising events. Our theory predicts human action choices with high probability and allows us to dissociate surprise, novelty, and reward in EEG signals.},

	abstract = {Intrinsically motivated spontaneous exploration is a key enabler of autonomous lifelong learning in human children. It enables the discovery and acquisition of large repertoires of skills through self-generation, self-selection, self-ordering and self-experimentation of learning goals. We present an algorithmic approach called Intrinsically Motivated Goal Exploration Processes (IMGEP) to enable similar properties of autonomous or self-supervised learning in machines. The IMGEP algorithmic architecture relies on several principles: 1) self-generation of goals, generalized as ﬁtness functions; 2) selection of goals based on intrinsic rewards; 3) exploration with incremental goal-parameterized policy search and exploitation of the gathered data with a batch learning algorithm; 4) systematic reuse of information acquired when targeting a goal for improving towards other goals. We present a particularly efﬁcient form of IMGEP, called Modular Population-Based IMGEP, that uses a population-based policy and an object-centered modularity in goals and mutations. We provide several implementations of this architecture and demonstrate their ability to automatically generate a learning curriculum within several experimental setups including a real humanoid robot that can explore multiple spaces of goals with several hundred continuous dimensions. While no particular target goal is provided to the system, this curriculum allows the discovery of skills that act as stepping stone for learning more complex skills, e.g. nested tool use. We show that learning diverse spaces of goals with intrinsic motivations is more efﬁcient for learning complex skills than only trying to directly learn these complex skills.},

	abstract = {In open-ended environments, autonomous learning agents must set their own goals and build their own curriculum through an intrinsically motivated exploration. They may consider a large diversity of goals, aiming to discover what is controllable in their environments, and what is not. Because some goals might prove easy and some impossible, agents must actively select which goal to practice at any moment, to maximize their overall mastery on the set of learnable goals. This paper proposes CURIOUS, an algorithm that leverages 1) a modular Universal Value Function Approximator with hindsight learning to achieve a diversity of goals of different kinds within a unique policy and 2) an automated curriculum learning mechanism that biases the attention of the agent towards goals maximizing the absolute learning progress. Agents focus sequentially on goals of increasing complexity, and focus back on goals that are being forgotten. Experiments conducted in a new modular-goal robotic environment show the resulting developmental self-organization of a learning curriculum, and demonstrate properties of robustness to distracting goals, forgetting and changes in body properties.},

We believe each captures important aspects of play across species; however, we believe none of them accounts for the extraordinary richness of human play or its connection to distinctively human learning. In thinking about play, we are particularly struck by the profligacy with which children set seemingly arbitrary rewards and incur unnecessary costs. We suggest that researchers take the seeming inutility of play seriously and consider why it might be useful to engage in apparently useless behavior. We propose that humans’ ability to choose arbitrary costs and rewards allows us to pursue novel goals, discover unexpected information, and invent problems we would not otherwise encounter. Because problems impose constraints on search, these invented problems may help solve a big problem: how to generate new ideas and plans in an otherwise infinite search space.},

It is unclear, however, whether these computational modeling studies, which have employed a wide variety of tasks and model variants, have reached convergent conclusions. In this review, we examine whether the tuning of model parameters that govern different aspects of learning and decisionmaking processes vary consistently as a function of age, and what neurocognitive developmental changes may account for differences in these parameter estimates across development. We explore whether patterns of developmental change in these estimates are better described by differences in the extent to which individuals adapt their learning processes to the statistics of different environments, or by more static learning biases that emerge across varied contexts. We focus specifically on learning rates and inverse temperature parameter esti­ mates, and find evidence that from childhood to adulthood, individuals become better at optimally weighting recent outcomes during learning across diverse contexts and less exploratory in their value-based decisionmaking. We provide recommendations for how these two possibilities — and potential alternative accounts —can be tested more directly to build a cohesive body of research that yields greater insight into the development of core learning processes.},

This cognitive profile is also found in other animals and is associated with early behaviours such as neophilia and play. I relate this developmental pattern to computational ideas about explore–exploit trade-offs, search and sampling, and to neuroscience findings. I also present several lines of empirical evidence suggesting that young human learners are highly exploratory, both in terms of their search for external information and their search through hypothesis spaces. In fact, they are sometimes more exploratory than older learners and adults.

Curiosity, we propose, is comprised of a family of mechanisms that range in complexity from simple heuristics based on novelty, salience, or surprise, to drives based on reward and uncertainty reduction and finally, to self-directed metacognitive processes. These mechanisms, we propose, have evolved to allow agents to discover useful regularities in the world ! steering them toward niches of maximal learning progress and away from both random and highly familiar tasks. We emphasize that curiosity arises organically in conjunction with cognition and motivation, being generated by cognitive processes and in turn, motivating them. We hope that this view will spur the systematic study of curiosity as an integral aspect of cognition and decision making during development and adulthood.},

	abstract = {Motor skill acquisition inherently depends on the way one practices the motor task. The amount of motor task variability during practice has been shown to foster transfer of the learned skill to other similar motor tasks. In addition, variability in a learning schedule, in which a task and its variations are interweaved during practice, has been shown to help the transfer of learning in motor skill acquisition. However, there is little evidence on how motor task variations and variability schedules during practice act on the acquisition of complex motor skills such as music performance, in which a performer learns both the right movements (motor skill) and the right time to perform them (timing skill). This study investigated the impact of rate (tempo) variability and the schedule of tempo change during practice on timing and motor skill acquisition. Complete novices, with no musical training, practiced a simple musical sequence on a piano keyboard at different rates. Each novice was assigned to one of four learning conditions designed to manipulate the amount of tempo variability across trials (large or small tempo set) and the schedule of tempo change (randomized or non-randomized order) during practice. At test, the novices performed the same musical sequence at a familiar tempo and at novel tempi (testing tempo transfer), as well as two novel (but related) sequences at a familiar tempo (testing spatial transfer). We found that practice conditions had little effect on learning and transfer performance of timing skill. Interestingly, practice conditions influenced motor skill learning (reduction of movement variability): lower temporal variability during practice facilitated transfer to new tempi and new sequences; non-randomized learning schedule improved transfer to new tempi and new sequences. Tempo (rate) and the sequence difficulty (spatial manipulation) affected performance variability in both timing and movement. These findings suggest that there is a dissociable effect of practice variability on learning complex skills that involve both motor and timing constraints.},

Our hypothesis is that DDA systems may lead players to overconfidence, revealed by an overestimation of their success chances when betting. This boost of confidence may be a part of the positive impact of DDA systems on the quality of game experience. We explain our method to evaluate player’s confidence and implement it into three games related to logical, motor and sensory difficulties. We describe two experimental conditions where difficulty is either randomly chosen or adapted using a DDA algorithm. Results show how DDA systems can lead players to high level of overconfidence.},

In a subliminal priming paradigm we show that participants overestimated how much control they had over objectively uncontrollable stimuli, which appeared after free- or forcedchoice actions, when a masked prime activated a representation of the stimuli immediately before each action. This prime-induced control-illusion was independent from whether primes were consciously perceived.

This, in turn, hinders and slows down the use of educational activities (e.g. providing practice questions) and new advances (e.g. adaptive testing) that require a large pool of questions. To reduce the expenses associated with manual construction of questions and to satisfy the need for a continuous supply of new questions, automatic question generation (AQG) techniques were introduced. This review extends a previous review on AQG literature that has been published up to late 2014. It includes 93 papers that were between 2015 and early 2019 and tackle the automatic generation of questions for educational purposes. The aims of this review are to: provide an overview of the AQG community and its activities, summarise the current trends and advances in AQG, highlight the changes that the area has undergone in the recent years, and suggest areas for improvement and future opportunities for AQG. Similar to what was found previously, there is little focus in the current literature on generating questions of controlled difficulty, enriching question forms and structures, automating template construction, improving presentation, and generating feedback. Our findings also suggest the need to further improve experimental reporting, harmonise evaluation metrics, and investigate other evaluation methods that are more feasible.},

The extent of the challenge includes fielding a real-time automatic contestant on the show, not merely a laboratory exercise. The Jeopardy! Challenge helped us address requirements that led to the design of the DeepQA architecture and the implementation of Watson. After 3 years of intense research and development by a core team of about 20 researches, Watson is performing at human expert-levels in terms of precision, confidence and speed at the Jeopardy!

Our results strongly suggest that DeepQA is an effective and extensible architecture that may be used as a foundation for combining, deploying, evaluating and advancing a wide range of algorithmic techniques to rapidly advance the field of QA.},

We discuss our approach with regard to the psychophysical studies of subjective diﬃculty and to the cognitive psychology research on overconﬁdence bias. We assume that the strong motivational pull of video games may lead players to be overconﬁdent and underestimate their chances of failure. Our method is tested within three games related to three types of diﬃculty, where the players have to bet on their capacity to win each challenge. Results conﬁrm the existence of a gap between the players actual and self-evaluated chances of failure. More precisely, players seem to strongly underestimate high levels of diﬃculty. Results do not show any inﬂuence of the players gender, feeling of self-eﬃcacy, risk aversion and gaming habits on the diﬃculty estimation error.},

	abstract = {Can we tell whether our beliefs and judgments are correct or wrong? Results across many domains indicate that people are skilled at discriminating between correct and wrong answers, endorsing the former with greater confidence than the latter. However, it has not been realized that because of people’s adaptation to reality, representative samples of items tend to favor the correct answer, yielding objectlevel accuracy (OLA) that is considerably better than chance. Across 16 experiments that used 2-alternative forced-choice items from several domains, the confidence/accuracy (C/A) relationship was positive for items with OLA Ͼ50\%, but consistently negative across items with OLA Ͻ50\%. A systematic sampling of items that covered the full range of OLA (0 –100\%) yielded a U-function relating confidence to OLA. The results imply that the positive C/A relationship that has been reported in many studies is an artifact of OLA being better than chance rather than representing a general ability to discriminate between correct and wrong responses. However, the results also support the ecological approach, suggesting that confidence is based on a frugal, “bounded” heuristic that has been specifically tailored to the ecological structure of the natural environment. This heuristic is used despite the fact that for items with OLA Ͻ50\%, it yields confidence judgments that are counterdiagnostic of accuracy. Our ability to tell between correct and wrong judgments is confined to the probability structure of the world we live in. The results were discussed in terms of the contrast between systematic design and representative design.},

Another looks upward by locating trait curiosity within the larger structure of global personality traits. This article reviews research that looks upward by locating curiosity within modern models of Openness to Experience. Most—but not all—models of Openness to Experience explicitly include curiosity-related facets, but they favor curiosity’s academic and intellectual forms. Based on recent network-psychometric analyses, we propose that a broader sense of curiosity—captured by intellectual curiosity, intellectual interests, and variety seeking—emerges from a large pool of Openness to Experience inventories, and that these curiosity facets are central to the global trait. Network science models offer a fruitful strategy for building a hierarchical model of curiosity across different levels of abstraction.},

We find a developmental shift in children’s reliance on hypothesis-scanning questions (which test hypotheses directly) versus constraint-seeking questions (which reduce the space of hypotheses), but also that all age groups ask more constraint-seeking questions when hypothesis-scanning questions are unlikely to pay off: when the problem is difficult (Studies 1 and 2) or the solution is one among equally likely alternatives (Study 2).

It is therefore a catalyst for their ability to learn from others.

The aim of this review is to provide a framework for organizing past and future research on question-asking and to use this framework to describe what development and variability in children’s question asking looks like between infancy and the elementary school years. We propose that question-asking can be divided into four components: (1) initiation, (2) formulation, (3) expression, and (4) response evaluation and follow-up. Drawing on research from the ﬁelds of psychology, education, and developmental psycholinguistics we review what is known and not known about these four components between infancy and elementary school as well as describe sources of variability across development.},

Findings also show a dynamic link between teacher and student motivation, as teachers are themselves impacted and constrained by controlling mandates, institutional pressures, and leadership styles. Ironically, despite substantial evidence for the importance of psychological need satisfactions in learning contexts, many current educational policies and practices around the globe remain anchored in traditional motivational models that fail to support students’ and teachers’ needs, a knowledge versus policy gap we should aspire to close.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Although children’s curiosity is thought to be important for early learning, the association of curiosity with early academic achievement has not been tested. We hypothesized that greater curiosity would be associated with greater kindergarten academic achievement in reading and math.
METHODS: Sample included 6200 children in the Early Childhood Longitudinal Study, Birth Cohort. Measures at kindergarten included direct assessments of reading and math, and a parent-report behavioral questionnaire from which we derived measures of curiosity and effortful control. Multivariate linear regression examined associations of curiosity with kindergarten reading and math academic achievement, adjusting for effortful control and confounders. We also tested for moderation by effortful control, sex, and socioeconomic status (SES).
RESULTS: In adjusted models, greater curiosity was associated with greater kindergarten reading and math academic achievement: breading = 0.11, p {\textless} 0.001; bmath = 0.12, p {\textless} 0.001. This association was not moderated by effortful control or sex, but was moderated by SES (preading = 0.01; pmath = 0.005). The association of curiosity with academic achievement was greater for children with low SES (breading = 0.18, p {\textless} 0.001; bmath = 0.20, p {\textless} 0.001), versus high SES (breading = 0.08, p = 0.004; bmath = 0.07, p {\textless} 0.001).
CONCLUSIONS: Curiosity may be an important, yet under-recognized contributor to academic achievement. Fostering curiosity may optimize academic achievement at kindergarten, especially for children with low SES. Pediatric Research (2018) 84:380–386; https://doi.org/10.1038/s41390-018-0039-3},

	abstract = {Evaluating stimuli along a good–bad dimension is a fundamental computation performed by the human mind. In recent decades, research has documented dissociations and associations between explicit (i.e., self-reported) and implicit (i.e., indirectly measured) forms of evaluations. However, it is unclear whether such dissociations arise from relatively more superficial differences in measurement techniques or from deeper differences in the processes by which explicit and implicit evaluations are acquired and represented. The present project (total
              N
              = 2,354) relies on the computationally well-specified distinction between model-based and model-free reinforcement learning to investigate the unique and shared aspects of explicit and implicit evaluations. Study 1 used a revaluation procedure to reveal that, whereas explicit evaluations of novel targets are updated via model-free and model-based processes, implicit evaluations depend on the former but are impervious to the latter. Studies 2 and 3 demonstrated the robustness of this effect to (
              i
              ) the number of stimulus exposures in the revaluation phase and (
              ii
              ) the deterministic vs. probabilistic nature of initial reinforcement. These findings provide a framework, going beyond traditional dual-process and single-process accounts, to highlight the context-sensitivity and long-term recalcitrance of implicit evaluations as well as variations in their relationship with their explicit counterparts. These results also suggest avenues for designing theoretically guided interventions to produce change in implicit evaluations.},

While computational models can explain exploratory behavior in constrained laboratory tasks, it is unclear to what extent these models generalize to real-world choice problems. We investigate the factors guiding exploratory behavior in a dataset consisting of 195,333 customers placing 1,613,967 orders from a large online food delivery service. We find important hallmarks of adaptive exploration and generalization, which we analyze using computational models. In particular, customers seem to engage in uncertainty-directed exploration and use feature-based generalization to guide their exploration. Our results provide evidence that people use sophisticated strategies to explore complex, real-world environments.},

Should I associate the positive outcome of safely completing a street-crossing with the situation “the car approaching the crosswalk was red” or “the approaching car was slowing down”? In this Perspective, we summarize our recent research into the computational and neural underpinnings of “representation learning” — how humans (and other animals) construct task representations that allow efficient learning and decision making. We first discuss the problem of learning what to ignore when confronted with too much information, so that experience can properly generalize across situations. We then turn to the problem of augmenting perceptual information with inferred latent causes that embody unobservable task-relevant information such as contextual knowledge. Finally, we discuss recent findings regarding the neural substrates of task representations that suggest the orbitofrontal cortex represents “task states,” deploying them for decision-making and learning elsewhere in the brain.},

In this chapter, we combine this work to address the nature of curiosity, where it fits in the larger scheme of positive emotions, the advantages of being curious in social relationships, links between curiosity and elements of well-being, and how it has been used in interventions to improve people’s quality of life. Our emphasis is on methodologically sophisticated findings that show how curiosity operates in the laboratory and everyday life, and how, under certain conditions, curiosity can be a profound source of strength or a liability. People who are regularly curious and willing to embrace the novelty, uncertainty, and challenges that are inevitable as we navigate the shoals of everyday life are at an advantage in creating a fulfilling existence compared with their less curious peers. Our brief review is designed to bring further attention to this neglected, underappreciated, human universal.},

This “play as rational exploration” view suggests that children’s play is sensitive to costs, rewards, and expected information gain. By contrast, here we suggest that a deﬁning feature of human play is that children subvert normal utility functions in play, setting up problems where they incur needless costs to achieve arbitrary rewards. Across four studies, we show that 4-5-year-old children not only infer playful behavior from observed violations of rational action (Experiment 1), but themselves take on unnecessary costs and perform inefﬁcient actions during play, despite understanding and valuing efﬁciency in non-playful, instrumental contexts (Experiment 2-4). We end with a discussion of the value of apparently utility-violating behavior and why it might serve learning in the long run.},

In a selection task, the learner actively chooses observations to test his or her beliefs, whereas in reception tasks data are passively encountered. People routinely use both forms of testing in everyday life, but the critical psychological differences between selection and reception learning remain poorly understood. One hypothesis is that selection learning improves learning performance by enhancing generic cognitive processes related to motivation, attention, and engagement. Alternatively, we suggest that differences between these 2 learning modes derives from a hypothesis-dependent sampling bias that is introduced when a person collects data to test his or her own individual hypothesis. Drawing on influential models of sequential hypothesis-testing behavior, we show that such a bias (a) can lead to the collection of data that facilitates learning compared with reception learning and (b) can be more effective than observing the selections of another person. We then report a novel experiment based on a popular category learning paradigm that compares reception and selection learning. We additionally compare selection learners to a set of “yoked” participants who viewed the exact same sequence of observations under reception conditions. The results revealed systematic differences in performance that depended on the learner’s role in collecting information and the abstract structure of the problem.},

It is argued that theoretical accounts of curiosity proposed during the 1st period fell short in 2 areas: They did not offer an adequate explanation for why people voluntarily seek out curiosity, and the failed to delineate situational determinants of curiosity. Futhermore, these accounts did not draw attention to, and thus did not explain, certain salient characteristics of curiosity, its intensity, transience, association with impulsivity, and tendency to disappoint when satisfied. A new account of curiosity is offered that attempts to address these shortcomings.

The brain systems underpinning these processes are the same as those used to detect animacy and infer mental states from human behaviour. However, it is not yet known if the brain systems that respond to human action-goals also respond to the action-goals of shapes. In the present paper, we used a repetition suppression paradigm during functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to examine brain systems that respond to the action-goals of shapes. Participants watched video clips of simple, geometrical shapes performing different ‘take-object’ goals. Repeated presentation of the same goal suppressed the blood oxygen level-dependent (BOLD) response in left anterior intraparietal sulcus (aIPS), a brain region known to distinguish the goals of human hand actions. This ﬁnding shows that left aIPS shows similar sensitivity to the action-goals of human and non-human agents. Our data complement previous work on animacy perception and mental state inference, which suggest components of the social brain are driven by the type of action comprehension that is engaged rather than by the form of the acting agent (i.e., human or shape). Further, the results have consequence for theories of goal understanding in situations without access to biological form or motion.},

However, the cognitive and neural mechanisms which underlie this ability are hotly debated. The current study was designed to identify brain regions involved in the representation of others' goals early in development. Studies with adults have demonstrated that the anterior intraparietal sulcus (aIPS) exhibits repetition suppression for repeated goals and a release from suppression for new goals, implicating this speciﬁc region in goal representation in adults. In the current study, we used a modiﬁed paired repetition suppression design with 9-month-old infants to identify which cortical regions are suppressed when the infant observes a repeated goal versus a new goal. We ﬁnd a strikingly similar response pattern and location of activity as had been reported in adults; the only brain region displaying signiﬁcant repetition suppression for repeated goals and a release from suppression for new goals was the left anterior parietal region. Not only does our data suggest that the left anterior parietal region is specialized for representing the goals of others' actions from early in life, this demonstration presents an opportunity to use this method and design to elucidate the debate over the mechanisms and cues which contribute to early action understanding.},

Participants read stories in which two unknown causes led to an outcome in either a converging or linear structure. They were then asked to select two of three possible causes to complete the story. Two candidates were semantically-related, direct causes of the outcome. The third was an unrelated, indirect cause of the outcome that was conditional on a directly-related event. Differences in abstract structure, and not association, guided people’s evaluations of the most likely causes (e.g., ‘breeze blowing’ was judged an unlikely direct cause of a noisy room compared to ‘alarm ringing’ or ‘door slamming’, but a likely indirect cause, conditional on the door slamming). Results demonstrate that people consider abstract information about the structure of an event when evaluating causes. Knowledge of causal structure may therefore guide hypothesis evaluation.},

	abstract = {Curiosity is a fundamental driver of human behavior, and yet because of its open-ended nature and the wide variety of behaviors it inspires in different contexts, it is remarkably difficult to study in a laboratory context. A promising approach to developing and testing theories of curiosity is to instantiate them in artificial agents that are able to act and explore in a simulated environment, and then compare the behavior of these agents to humans exploring the same stimuli. Here we propose a new experimental paradigm for examining children’s – and AI agents’ – curiosity about objects’ physical interactions. We let them choose which object to drop another object onto in order to create the most interesting effect. We compared adults’ (N=155) and children’s choices (N=66; 3-7 year-olds) and found that both children and adults show a strong preference for choosing target objects that could potentially contain the dropped object. Adults alone also make choices consistent with achieving support relations. We contextualize our results using heuristic computational models based on 3D physical simulations of the same scenarios judged by participants.},

To answer the question, in this essay, I argue that motivation does not exist in our mental processes --- rather, motivation is a naïve linguistic expression that loosely represents emergent properties of underlying mental processes. Therefore, there are no definitive features of motivation, and there is no such entity in our mental processes. As an example, I showed that a reward-learning framework of knowledge acquisition can sufficiently describe autonomous behaviors often attributed to “need for competence”, without assuming the existence of such motivation. I further argue that the term motivation is so useful to explain behavior that it could often even stop us from thinking deeply about our mental processes, potentially preventing the mechanistic understanding of human mind.},

We first study theories in psychology to shed light on the underpinnings of human curiosity, where a two-step process is proposed to serve as a general model for analyzing curiosity. Subsequently, existing models of computational curiosity are reviewed under the proposed framework. We conclude the review by identifying 4 key research issues in computational curiosity and 10 important research areas where computational curiosity could bring significant impact.},

This effect was robust to differing reward contingencies and across in-person and online testing contexts. Older children made more accurate predictions about their performance, and in some contexts were more likely to choose a challenge, than younger children.

	abstract = {Children accrue experiences with buoyancy on a daily basis, yet research paints a mixed picture of children’s buoyancy knowledge. Whereas children’s predictions and explanations of the ﬂoating and the sinking of common objects are often based on a single feature (e.g., mass or facts), children’s predictions of novel cubes reveal solution strategies based on mass and volume integrations. Correspondingly, category learning theory suggests that categories (e.g., ﬂoaters vs. sinkers) are easier to identify when items mainly vary from one another in the relevant deﬁning features. For example, a set of cubes only varies in mass and volume and hence density, thereby being able to highlight the deterministic role of density when placed in water. Here we asked how item variation during hands-on exploration affects children’s subsequent predictions and explanations of buoyancy. Kindergarteners and ﬁrst-, second-, and third-grade children individually explored either a set of 10 systematically varied cubes (i.e., systematic condition; n = 95) or a set of 10 common objects (i.e., non-systematic condition; n = 96) in a water basin. Next, the children predicted the buoyancy of ﬁve new cubes and ﬁve new common objects one at a time. Subsequently, the children explained their predictions one subset at a time. The children in the systematic condition were more accurate in their predictions of the test cubes than the children in the non-systematic condition. Latent class regression analyses identiﬁed three cube prediction solution strategies. The children in the systematic condition were more likely to use a strategy in which buoyancy decisions were made based on an accurate integration of mass and volume, while the children in the non-systematic condition were more likely to use a strategy in which mass was given more predictive load than volume. A third strategy was characterized by guessing. Latent class analyses of the children’s explanations revealed different explanation strategies, each appealing to several features, but as hypothesized, no clear condition differences were found. The ﬁndings indicate that even 5 min of exploration with systematically varied cubes can already help children use an advanced buoyancy prediction strategy. This provides evidence in favor of using category learning theory to inform early science education design.},

            Curiosity stimulates learning. We tested whether curiosity itself can be stimulated—not by extrinsic rewards but by an intrinsic desire to know whether a prediction holds true. Participants performed a numerical-facts learning task in which they had to generate either a prediction or an example before rating their curiosity and seeing the correct answer. More facts received high-curiosity ratings in the prediction condition, which indicates that generating predictions stimulated curiosity. In turn, high curiosity, compared with low curiosity, was associated with better memory for the correct answer. Concurrent pupillary data revealed that higher curiosity was associated with larger pupil dilation during anticipation of the correct answer. Pupil dilation was further enhanced when participants generated a prediction rather than an example, both during anticipation of the correct answer and in response to seeing it. These results suggest that generating a prediction stimulates curiosity by increasing the relevance of the knowledge gap.},

The work reviewed stems from prominent achievement motivation theories: expectancy-value theory, social cognitive theory, self-worth theory, and self-determination theory. Broadly, research on the development of children’s expectancy and competence beliefs for diﬀerent achievement tasks shows that these beliefs decline from kindergarten to 12th grade, although there are diﬀerent patterns of decline. Across age children’s expectancy beliefs relate more strongly to, or become better calibrated with, their performance on achievement activities. Such calibration impacts students’ motivation and selfregulation for exams and other assignments. Children’s expectancies are inﬂuenced by the feedback (supportive or critical) given to them by parents and teachers, as well as by parents’ and teachers’ expectancies for them. School instructional practices, notably ability grouping and tracking, diﬀerentially inﬂuence children’s developing expectancies. Peers also impact each other’s expectancy beliefs.

	abstract = {Across ontogenetic development, individuals gather manifold experiences during which they detect regularities in their environment and thereby accumulate knowledge. This knowledge is used to guide behavior, make predictions, and acquire further new knowledge. In this review, we discuss the inﬂuence of prior knowledge on memory from both the psychology and the emerging cognitive neuroscience literature and provide a developmental perspective on this topic. Recent neuroscience ﬁndings point to a prominent role of the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) and of the hippocampus (HC) in the emergence of prior knowledge and in its application during the processes of successful memory encoding, consolidation, and retrieval. We take the lateral PFC into consideration as well and discuss changes in both medial and lateral PFC and HC across development and postulate how these may be related to the development of the use of prior knowledge for remembering. For future direction, we argue that, to measure age differential effects of prior knowledge on memory, it is necessary to distinguish the availability of prior knowledge from its accessibility and use.},

Next, we explain that interest defined as a psychological state and as a cognitive and motivational variable can be supported to develop. Furthermore, the content-specific development of interest provides a different type of information search than curiosity, defined as the motivation to close a knowledge gap driven by uncertainty. We also discuss how earlier and later phases of developing interest are related to curiosity. More specifically, we suggest that (a) once curiosity is resolved, it may not result in any further engagement, or it may trigger a situational interest that could develop, and (b) when an existing, more developed interest initiates, supports or is related to a particular instance of triggered curiosity, continued engagement (and information search) is likely. In concluding, we point to needed neuroscientific research that could contribute to further clarifying the relation between interest and curiosity.

	abstract = {Across the lifespan, humans direct their learning towards information they are curious to know. However, it is unclear what elicits curiosity, and whether and how this changes across development. Is curiosity triggered by surprise and uncertainty, as prior research suggests, or by expected learning, which is often confounded with these features? In the present research, we use a Bayesian reinforcement learning model to quantify and disentangle surprise, uncertainty, and expected learning. We use the resulting model-estimated features to predict curiosity ratings from 5- to 9-year-olds and adults in an augmented multi-armed bandit task. Like adults’ curiosity, children’s curiosity was best predicted by expected learning. However, after accounting for expected learning, children (but not adults) were also more curious when uncertainty was higher and surprise lower. This research points to developmental changes in what elicits curiosity and calls for a reexamination of research that confounds these elicitors.},

	abstract = {Curiosity drives much of human behavior, but its open-ended nature makes it hard to study in the laboratory. Moreover, computational theories of curiosity – models of how intrinsic motivation promotes complex behaviors – have been challenging to test because of technical limits. To circumvent this problem, we develop a new way to assess intrinsic motivation for building: we assume people build what they find interesting, so we asked them to rate the “interestingness” of visual stimuli – in this case, simple block towers. Adults gave a range of ratings to towers built by children, with taller towers rated higher. To probe interestingness further, we developed controlled tower stimuli in a simulated 3D environment. While tower height predicted much of the variation in ratings, people also favored more precarious towers, as inferred from geometric features and simulated dynamics. These ratings and features therefore give a clear target for computational accounts of curiosity to explain.},

Grit was the only candidate strength that predicted increased goal attainment from T1 to T2 and from T2 to T3, and Curiosity was the only candidate strength that moderated attainment effects on well-being from T1 to T2 and from T2 to T3.

Infants were presented with an impossible task and exploratory behavior was classified. Infants decreased effort with increased experience failing, but persisted for longer when using several exploratory strategies and exploring for proportionally longer. These results confirm that infants are sensitive to the utility of their actions, and that exploration offers a means to persist even in the face of failure.},

	abstract = {For more than two decades, there has been converging evidence for an essential role of the cerebellum in non-motor functions. The cerebellum is not only important in learning and sensorimotor processes, some growing evidences show its implication in conditional learning and reward, which allows building our expectations about behavioral outcomes. More recent work has demonstrated that the cerebellum is also required for the sense of agency, a cognitive process that allows recognizing an action as our own, suggesting that the cerebellum might serve as an interface between sensorimotor function and cognition. A unifying model that would explain the role of the cerebellum across these processes has not been fully established. Nonetheless, an important heritage was given by the ﬁeld of motor control: the forward model theory. This theory stipulates that movements are controlled based on the constant interactions between our organism and its environment through feedforward and feedback loops. Feedforward loops predict what is going to happen, while feedback loops confront the prediction with what happened so that we can react accordingly. From an anatomical point of view, the cerebellum is at an ideal location at the interface between the motor and sensory systems, as it is connected to cerebral, striatal, and spinal entities via parallel loops, so that it can link sensory and motor systems with cognitive processes. Recent ﬁndings showing that the cerebellum participates in building the sense of agency as a predictive and comparator system will be reviewed together with past work on motor control within the context of the forward model theory.},

During functional neuroimaging, participants rated either the pleasantness (explicit task) or the age (distractive task) of pictures from different categories (face, house, and painting). After scanning, the same pictures were presented in pairs, and subjects had to choose the one they preferred. We isolated brain regions that reﬂect both values (pleasantness ratings) and preferences (binary choices). Preferences were encoded whatever the stimulus (face, house, or painting) and task (explicit or distractive). These regions may therefore constitute a brain system that automatically engages in valuating the various components of our environment so as to inﬂuence our future choices.},

In this paper, we address the definition issue by arguing that there is inherent difficulty in defining curiosity and interest, because both curiosity and interest are naïve concepts, which are not supposed to have a priori scientific definitions. We present a reward-learning framework of autonomous knowledge acquisition and use this framework to illustrate the importance of process account as an alternative to advance our understanding of curiosity and interest without being troubled by their definitions. The framework centers on the role of rewarding experience associated with knowledge acquisition and learning and posits that the acquisition of new knowledge strengthens the value of further information. Critically, we argue that curiosity and interest are the concepts that they subjectively construe through this knowledge-acquisition process. Finally, we discuss the implications of the reward-learning framework for education and empirical research in educational psychology.},

Several researchers have suggested bringing the number up to eleven, on the basis of empirical data. In this article the authors explore this rational and share the same view, but simulate artiﬁcial data from both symmetrical normal and skewed distributions where the underlying metric is known in advance. Results show that more Likert scale points will result in a closer approach to the underlying distribution, and hence normality and interval scales.

	abstract = {Infants are curious learners who drive their own cognitive development by imposing structure on their learning environment as they explore. Understanding the mechanisms by which infants structure their own learning is therefore critical to our understanding of development. Here we propose an explicit mechanism for intrinsically motivated information selection that maximizes learning. We first present a neurocomputational model of infant visual category learning, capturing existing empirical data on the role of environmental complexity on learning. Next we “set the model free”, allowing it to select its own stimuli based on a formalization of curiosity and three alternative selection mechanisms. We demonstrate that maximal learning emerges when the model is able to maximize stimulus novelty relative to its internal states, depending on the interaction across learning between the structure of the environment and the plasticity in the learner itself. We discuss the implications of this new curiosity mechanism for both existing computational models of reinforcement learning and for our understanding of this fundamental mechanism in early development.},

	abstract = {It is now commonly accepted that the motor system makes use of so-called forward and inverse models in order to control the musculoskeletal system during rapid, skilled, motor behaviour. Inverse models are held to allow the system to determine the motor commands necessary to achieve a desired state, while forward models are held to allow the system to predict the expected sensory feedback of a motor command, allowing rapid error detection when actual and predicted feedback do not match. It has recently been suggested that these ideas from control theory might also be applied to the control of cognitive processes, allowing (for example) the cognitive system to anticipate processing conflict and pre-emptively minimise it by adjusting processing strategies or the allocation of processing resources.12This paper reviews theories of cognitive control that are broadly consistent with the use of complementary forward and inverse models. It is argued that there is indeed a role for such models in cognitive control – particularly in relation to a putative monitoring function – but that the models involved are likely to be somewhat impoverished.},

To address this issue, the present study used a manual motion-tracking task that allowed for a sensitive measure of both accuracy and improvement over time. When the target motion pattern was consistent over trials, gamers improved with a faster rate and eventually outperformed non-gamers. Performance between the two groups, however, did not differ initially. When the target motion was inconsistent, changing on every trial, results revealed no difference between gamers and non-gamers. Together, our ﬁndings suggest that video game playing confers no reliable beneﬁt in sensorimotor control, but it does enhance sensorimotor learning, enabling superior performance in tasks with consistent and predictable structure.},

Prediction turns motor commands into expected sensory consequences [1], whereas control turns desired consequences into motor commands. To capture this symmetry, the neural processes underlying prediction and control are termed the forward and inverse internal models, respectively [2–5]. Here, we investigate how these two fundamental processes are related during motor learning. We used an object manipulation task in which subjects learned to move a hand-held object with novel dynamic properties along a prescribed path. We independently and simultaneously measured subjects’ ability to control their actions and to predict their consequences. We found different time courses for predictor and controller learning, with prediction being learned far more rapidly than control. In early stages of manipulating the object, subjects could predict the consequences of their actions, as measured by the grip force they used to grasp the object, but could not generate appropriate actions for control, as measured by their hand trajectory. As predicted by several recent theoretical models of sensorimotor control [6–8], our results indicate that people can learn to predict the consequences of their actions before they can learn to control their actions.},

	abstract = {Every environment contains infinite potential features and correlations among features, or patterns. Detecting valid and learnable patterns in one environment is beneficial for learners because doing so lends predictability to new environments where the same or analogous patterns recur. However, some apparent correlations among features reflect spurious patterns, and attempting to learn the latter costs time and resources with no advantage to the learner. Thus, an efficient learner in a complex environment needs to devote more attention to input that reflects a real and learnable pattern than to input that reflects a spurious or ultimately unlearnable pattern. However, in order to achieve such efficiency in the absence of external feedback, learners need to have an implicit metric of their own learning progress. Do human infants have such a metric? Data from two experiments demonstrate that 17-month-olds attend longer to learnable vs. unlearnable linguistic grammars, taking more trials to habituate and more overall time to habituate for grammars in which a valid generalization over input stimuli can be made. These data provide the first evidence that infants have an implicit metric of their own learning progress and preferentially direct their attention to learnable aspects of their environment.},

However, it remains unclear to what extent self-directed learning is constrained by basic cognitive processes and how those limits are related to the structure of the to-be-learned material. The present study examined how hypothesis generation affects the success of self-directed learning of categorical rules. Two experiments manipulated the hypothesis generation process and assessed its impact on the ability to learn 1D and 2D rules. Performance was strongly inﬂuenced by whether the stimulus representation facilitated the generation of hypotheses consistent with the target rule. Broadly speaking, the ﬁndings suggest that the opportunity to actively gather information is not enough to guarantee successful learning, and that the efﬁcacy of self-directed learning closely depends on how hypothesis generation is shaped by the structure of the learning environment.},

	abstract = {Effective self-regulated learning in settings in which students can decide what tasks to work on, requires accurate self-assessment (i.e., a judgment of own level of performance) as well as accurate task selection (i.e., choosing a subsequent task that fits the current level of performance). Because self-assessment accuracy is often low, task-selection accuracy suffers as well and, consequently, self-regulated learning can lead to suboptimal learning outcomes. Recent studies have shown that a training with video modeling examples enhanced self-assessment accuracy on problem-solving tasks, but the training was not equally effective for every student and, overall, there was room for further improvement in self-assessment accuracy. Therefore, we investigated whether training with video examples followed by feedback focused on selfassessment accuracy would improve subsequent self-assessment and task-selection accuracy in the absence of the feedback. Experiment 1 showed, contrary to our hypothesis, that selfassessment feedback led to less accurate future self-assessments. In Experiment 2, we provided students with feedback focused on self-assessment accuracy plus information on the correct answers, or feedback focused on self-assessment accuracy, plus the correct answers and the opportunity to contrast those with their own answers. Again, however, we found no beneficial effect of feedback on subsequent self-assessment accuracy. In sum, we found no evidence that feedback on self-assessment accuracy improves subsequent accuracy. Therefore, future research should address other ways improving accuracy, for instance by taking into account the cues upon which students base their self-assessments.},

While previous research has demonstrated that young children show a precocious capacity for concept and theory building when they are provided with helpful data within training settings, and that they explore their environment in ways that may promote learning, it remains an open question whether young children are able to build larger conceptual structures using selfgenerated evidence, a form of active learning. In the current study, we examined whether children can learn high-order generalizations (which form the basis for larger conceptual structures) through free play, and whether they can do so as effectively as when provided with relevant data. Results with 2- and 3-year-old children over 4 experiments indicate robust learning through free play, and generalization performance was comparable between free play and didactic conditions. Therefore, young children’s self-directed learning supports the development of higher-order generalizations, laying the foundation for building larger conceptual structures and intuitive theories.},

The hierarchical structure of behavior has also been of enduring interest within neuroscience, where it has been widely considered to reﬂect prefrontal cortical functions. In this paper, we reexamine behavioral hierarchy and its neural substrates from the point of view of recent developments in computational reinforcement learning. Speciﬁcally, we consider a set of approaches known collectively as hierarchical reinforcement learning, which extend the reinforcement learning paradigm by allowing the learning agent to aggregate actions into reusable subroutines or skills. A close look at the components of hierarchical reinforcement learning suggests how they might map onto neural structures, in particular regions within the dorsolateral and orbital prefrontal cortex. It also suggests speciﬁc ways in which hierarchical reinforcement learning might provide a complement to existing psychological models of hierarchically structured behavior. A particularly important question that hierarchical reinforcement learning brings to the fore is that of how learning identiﬁes new action routines that are likely to provide useful building blocks in solving a wide range of future problems. Here and at many other points, hierarchical reinforcement learning offers an appealing framework for investigating the computational and neural underpinnings of hierarchically structured behavior.},

            Effective curiosity-driven learning requires recognizing that the value of evidence for testing hypotheses depends on what other hypotheses are under consideration. Do we intuitively represent the discriminability of hypotheses? Here we show children alternative hypotheses for the contents of a box and then shake the box (or allow children to shake it themselves) so they can hear the sound of the contents. We find that children are able to compare the evidence they hear with imagined evidence they do not hear but might have heard under alternative hypotheses. Children (N = 160; mean: 5 years and 4 months) prefer easier discriminations (Experiments 1-3) and explore longer given harder ones (Experiments 4-7). Across 16 contrasts, children’s exploration time quantitatively tracks the discriminability of heard evidence from an unheard alternative. The results are consistent with the idea that children have an “intuitive psychophysics”: children represent their own perceptual abilities and explore longer when hypotheses are harder to distinguish.},

In a subliminal priming paradigm we show that participants overestimated how much control they had over objectively uncontrollable stimuli, which appeared after free- or forcedchoice actions, when a masked prime activated a representation of the stimuli immediately before each action. This prime-induced control-illusion was independent from whether primes were consciously perceived. Results indicate that the conscious experience of control is modulated by unconscious anticipations of action-eVects.},

Prima facie, introspection and self-report appear the only way to access the subjective sense of confidence or uncertainty. Contrary to this notion, overt behavioural measures can be used to study confidence judgements by animals trained in decision-making tasks with perceptual or mnemonic uncertainty. Here, we suggest that a computational approach can clarify the issues involved in interpreting these tasks and provide a much needed springboard for advancing the scientific understanding of confidence. We first review relevant theories of probabilistic inference and decision-making. We then critically discuss behavioural tasks employed to measure confidence in animals and show how quantitative models can help to constrain the computational strategies underlying confidence-reporting behaviours. In our view, post-decision wagering tasks with continuous measures of confidence appear to offer the best available metrics of confidence. Since behavioural reports alone provide a limited window into mechanism, we argue that progress calls for measuring the neural representations and identifying the computations underlying confidence reports. We present a case study using such a computational approach to study the neural correlates of decision confidence in rats. This work shows that confidence assessments may be considered higher order, but can be generated using elementary neural computations that are available to a wide range of species. Finally, we discuss the relationship of confidence judgements to the wider behavioural uses of confidence and uncertainty.},

Here, we review the psychological and neural underpinnings of metacognitive accuracy, drawing on research in memory and decision-making. These data show that metacognitive accuracy is dissociable from task performance and varies across individuals. Convergent evidence indicates that the function of the rostral and dorsal aspect of the lateral prefrontal cortex (PFC) is important for the accuracy of retrospective judgements of performance. In contrast, prospective judgements of performance may depend upon medial PFC. We close with a discussion of how metacognitive processes relate to concepts of cognitive control, and propose a neural synthesis in which dorsolateral and anterior prefrontal cortical subregions interact with interoceptive cortices (cingulate and insula) to promote accurate judgements of performance.},

	abstract = {Condorcet (1785) proposed that a majority vote drawn from individual, independent and fallible (but not totally uninformed) opinions provides near-perfect accuracy if the number of voters is adequately large. Research in social psychology has since then repeatedly demonstrated that collectives can and do fail more often than expected by Condorcet. Since human collective decisions often follow from exchange of opinions, these failures provide an exquisite opportunity to understand human communication of
              metacognitive confidence
              . This question can be addressed by recasting collective decision-making as an information-integration problem similar to multisensory (cross-modal) perception. Previous research in systems neuroscience shows that one brain can integrate information from multiple senses nearly optimally. Inverting the question, we ask: under what conditions can two brains integrate information about one sensory modality optimally? We review recent work that has taken this approach and report discoveries about the quantitative limits of collective perceptual decision-making, and the role of the mode of communication and feedback in collective decision-making. We propose that shared metacognitive confidence conveys the strength of an individual's opinion and its reliability inseparably. We further suggest that a functional role of shared metacognition is to provide substitute signals in situations where outcome is necessary for learning but unavailable or impossible to establish.},

Research in this area in the mental health field h as burgeoned with the development and widespread use of standard assessment instruments and the mapping out of the clinical and neuropsychological correlates of insight and its loss. There has been a growing appreciation of the multi-faceted nature of the concept and of the different ‘objects’ of insight, such as the general awareness that one is ill, to more specific metacognitive awareness of individual symptoms, impairments and performance. This in turn has led to the notion that insight may show modularity and may fractionate across different domains and disorders, supported by work that directly compares metacognition of memory deficits and illness awareness in patients with SCZ, Alzheimer's disease and brain injury. The focus of this paper will be on the varieties of metacognitive failure in psychiatry, particularly the psychoses. We explore cognitive models based on self-reflectiveness and their possible social and neurological bases, including data from structural and functional MRI. The medial frontal cortex appears to play an important role in self-appraisal in health and disease.},

Participants made metacognitive judgements of agency as well as judgements of performance. Control participants' judgements of agency were affected by the turbulence and lag variables—indicating that they knew they were objectively not in control in those conditions, and they were also influenced by their assessments of performance. The patients also used their assessments of performance but neither turbulence nor lag affected their judgements of agency. This indicated an impairment in agency monitoring. The patients, unlike the healthy controls, used only publically available external cues about performance in making judgements of ‘agency’ and did not rely on any additional access to internal self-relevant cues that were diagnostic in indicating whether or not they were, in fact, in control.},

	abstract = {Blindsight refers to the rare ability of V1-damaged patients to perform visual tasks such as forced-choice discrimination, even though these patients claim not to consciously see the relevant stimuli. This striking phenomenon can be described in the formal terms of signal detection theory. (i) Blindsight patients use an unusually conservative criterion to detect targets. (ii) In discrimination tasks, their confidence ratings are low and (iii) such confidence ratings poorly predict task accuracy on a trial-by-trial basis. (iv) Their detection capacity (
              d
              ′) is lower than expected based on their performance in forced-choice tasks. We propose a unifying explanation that accounts for these features: that blindsight is due to a failure to represent and update the statistical information regarding the internal visual neural response, i.e. a failure in metacognition. We provide computational simulation data to demonstrate that this model can qualitatively account for the detection theoretic features of blindsight. Because such metacognitive mechanisms are likely to depend on the prefrontal cortex, this suggests that although blindsight is typically due to damage to the primary visual cortex, distal influence to the prefrontal cortex by such damage may be critical. Recent brain imaging evidence supports this view.},

Here, we instead suggest that metacognition is but an instance of a larger class of representational re-description processes that we assume occur unconsciously and automatically. From this perspective, the brain continuously and unconsciously learns to anticipate the consequences of action or activity on itself, on the world and on other people through three predictive loops: an inner loop, a perception–action loop and a self–other (social cognition) loop, which together form a tangled hierarchy. We ask what kinds of mechanisms may subtend this form of enactive metacognition. We extend previous neural network simulations and compare the model with signal detection theory, highlighting that while the latter approach assumes that both type I (objective) and type II (subjective, metacognition-based) decisions tap into the same signal at different hierarchical levels, our approach is closer to dual-route models in which it is assumed that the re-descriptions made possible by the emergence of meta-representations occur independently and outside of the first-order causal chain. We close by reviewing relevant neurological evidence for the idea that awareness, self-awareness and social cognition involve the same mechanisms.},

We consider two classic settings in which cognitive development has been framed as model-building: (i) Core knowledge in infancy, and (ii) The child as scientist. We interpret learning in both of these settings as resource-constrained, hierarchical Bayesian program induction with diﬀerent primitives and constraints. We examine what mechanisms children could use to meet the algorithmic challenges of navigating large spaces of potential models, in particular the proposal of “the child as hacker” and how it might be realized drawing on recent computational advances. We also discuss prospects for a unifying account of model building across scientiﬁc theories and intuitive theories, and in biological and cultural evolution more generally.},

These accounts have thus far been unable to explain flexibility in children’s copying behavior (e.g., why children sometimes copy exactly and sometimes copy selectively). We propose that the complexity of children’s imitation can only be fully understood by considering the social context in which it is produced. Three critical factors in determining what is copied are children’s own (learning and/or social) goals in the situation, children’s identification with the model and with the social group in general, and the social pressures which children experience within the imitative situation. The specific combination of these factors which is present during the imitative interaction can lead children to produce a more or less faithful reproduction of the model’s act. Beyond explaining flexibility in children’s copying behavior, this approach situates the developmental study of imitation within a broader social psychological framework, linking it conceptually with closely related topics such as mimicry, conformity, normativity, and the cultural transmission of group differences.},

	abstract = {Understanding of the evolved biological function of sleep has advanced considerably in the past decade. However, no equivalent understanding of dreams has emerged. Contemporary neuroscientiﬁc theories often view dreams as epiphenomena, and many of the proposals for their biological function are contradicted by the phenomenology of dreams themselves. Now, the recent advent of deep neural networks (DNNs) has ﬁnally provided the novel conceptual framework within which to understand the evolved function of dreams. Notably, all DNNs face the issue of overﬁtting as they learn, which is when performance on one dataset increases but the network’s performance fails to generalize (often measured by the divergence of performance on training versus testing datasets). This ubiquitous problem in DNNs is often solved by modelers via ‘‘noise injections’’ in the form of noisy or corrupted inputs. The goal of this paper is to argue that the brain faces a similar challenge of overﬁtting and that nightly dreams evolved to combat the brain’s overﬁtting during its daily learning. That is, dreams are a biological mechanism for increasing generalizability via the creation of corrupted sensory inputs from stochastic activity across the hierarchy of neural structures. Sleep loss, speciﬁcally dream loss, leads to an overﬁtted brain that can still memorize and learn but fails to generalize appropriately. Herein this ’’overﬁtted brain hypothesis’’ is explicitly developed and then compared and contrasted with existing contemporary neuroscientiﬁc theories of dreams. Existing evidence for the hypothesis is surveyed within both neuroscience and deep learning, and a set of testable predictions is put forward that can be pursued both in vivo and in silico.},

A great deal is known about the adaptive functions of social learning, but very little about the cognitive mechanisms that make it possible. Even in the case of imitation, a type of social learning studied in both comparative psychology and cognitive science, there has been minimal contact between the two disciplines. Social learning has been isolated from cognitive science by two longstanding assumptions: that it depends on a set of special-purpose modules— cognitive adaptations for social living; and that these learning mechanisms are largely distinct from the processes mediating human social cognition. Recent research challenges these assumptions by showing that social learning covaries with asocial learning; occurs in solitary animals; and exhibits the same features in diverse species, including humans. Drawing on this evidence, I argue that social and asocial learning depend on the same basic learning mechanisms; these are adapted for the detection of predictive relationships in all natural domains; and they are associative mechanisms—processes that encode information for long-term storage by forging excitatory and inhibitory links between event representations. Thus, human and nonhuman social learning are continuous, and social learning is adaptively specialized—it becomes distinctively “social”— only when input mechanisms (perceptual, attentional, and motivational processes) are phylogenetically or ontogenetically tuned to other agents.},

Although previous developmental accounts of imitation have focused on imitation as a way to learn from others, the current article stresses that imitation goes far beyond this: It is often intimately tied to children’s need to belong to the group and their drive to afﬁliate with those around them. Accordingly, imitation is chieﬂy determined by the social motivations and pressures children experience within both interpersonal and intergroup settings. This perspective resolves an apparent paradox in the empirical literature, explaining why children sometimes copy selectively and sometimes copy faithfully (so-called overimitation).

	abstract = {A Region of Proximal Learning model is proposed emphasizing two components to peopleÕs study time allocation, controlled by diﬀerent metacognitive indices. The ﬁrst component is choice, which is further segmented into two stages: (1) a decision of whether to study or not and (2) the order of priority of items chosen. If the peopleÕs Judgments of Learning (JOLs) are suﬃciently high that they believe they know the items already, they will choose to not study. If they do choose to study, the order is from that which they believe is almost known to that which they believe is more diﬃcult (high JOL to low JOL). The second component is perseverance, with emphasis on the rule for stopping studying once study has begun on an item. We propose that people use a previously unexplored process-oriented metacognitive marker: their judgments of the rate of learning (jROLs), to decide when to stop. When learning is proceeding quickly and the jROL value is high they continue studying. When the jROL approaches zero, and their subjective assessment indicates learning is at a standstill they stop. The extant literature bearing on this model is reviewed, and eight new experiments, all of which support the model, are presented.},

Several computational models have been proposed to account for a range of effects, including error detection, conﬂict monitoring, error likelihood prediction, and numerous other effects observed with single-unit neurophysiology, fMRI, and lesion studies. Here, we review the state of computational models of cognitive control and offer a new theoretical synthesis of the mPFC as signaling response–outcome predictions. This new synthesis has two interacting components. The ﬁrst component learns to predict the various possible outcomes of a planned action, and the second component detects discrepancies between the actual and intended responses; the detected discrepancies in turn update the outcome predictions. This single construct is consistent with a wide array of performance monitoring effects in mPFC and suggests a unifying account of the cognitive role of medial PFC in performance monitoring.},

The conflict monitoring theory proposes that anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) contributes to cognitive control by detecting conflicts in information processing and signaling when increased top-down control is required. This theory provides a computationally specified framework for understanding how cognitive control is recruited, and explains a large literature of human neuroimaging studies reporting ACC activity in conditions of increased cognitive demand. Predictions from the theory have been tested and consistently confirmed in behavioral and neuroimaging experiments with human subjects. However, challenging findings from patients with ACC lesions, and from studies of ACC function in non-human primates, suggest that conflict monitoring may be just one facet of the broader role of ACC in performance monitoring and the optimization of behavior.},

However, individuals often need to make conscious strategic decisions that ideally would be based upon accurate knowledge of performance. Here we determined the extent to which individuals have explicit awareness of their steering performance (conceptualised as ‘metacognition’). Participants steered in a virtual environment along a bending road whilst attempting to keep within a central demarcated target zone. Task demands were altered by manipulating locomotor speed (fast/slow) and the target zone (narrow/wide). All participants received continuous visual feedback about position in zone, and one sub-group were given additional auditory warnings when exiting/entering the zone. At the end of each trial participants made a metacognitive evaluation: the proportion of the trial they believed was spent in the zone. Overall, whilst evaluations broadly shifted in line with task demands, participants showed limited calibration to performance. Regression analysis showed that evaluations were influenced by two components: i) direct monitoring of performance, and ii) indirect task heuristics estimating performance based on salient cues (e.g. speed). Evaluations often weighted indirect task heuristics inappropriately, but the additional auditory feedback improved evaluations seemingly by reducing this weighting. These results have important implications for all motor tasks where conscious cognitive control can be used to influence action selection.},

Two models of conﬁdence computation have been proposed: post hoc computation using post-decision variables and heuristics, versus online computation using continuous assessment of evidence throughout the decision-making process. Here, we arbitrate between these theories by continuously monitoring ﬁnger movements during a manual sequential decisionmaking task. Analysis of ﬁnger kinematics indicated that subjects kept separate online records of evidence and conﬁdence: ﬁnger deviation continuously reﬂected the ongoing accumulation of evidence, whereas ﬁnger speed continuously reﬂected the momentary degree of conﬁdence. Furthermore, end-of-trial ﬁnger speed predicted the post-decisional subjective conﬁdence rating. These data indicate that conﬁdence is computed on-line, throughout the decision process. Speed-conﬁdence correlations were previously interpreted as a post-decision heuristics, whereby slow decisions decrease subjective conﬁdence, but our results suggest an adaptive mechanism that involves the opposite causality: by slowing down when unconﬁdent, participants gain time to improve their decisions.},

We review neurophysiological and modeling studies in monkey that support a new theory of LC-NE function. LC neurons exhibit two modes of activity, phasic and tonic. Phasic LC activation is driven by the outcome of task-related decision processes and is proposed to facilitate ensuing behaviors and to help optimize task performance (exploitation). When utility in the task wanes, LC neurons exhibit a tonic activity mode, associated with disengagement from the current task and a search for alternative behaviors (exploration). Monkey LC receives prominent, direct inputs from the anterior cingulate (ACC) and orbitofrontal cortices (OFC), both of which are thought to monitor task-related utility. We propose that these frontal areas produce the above patterns of LC activity to optimize utility on both short and long timescales.},

Here we propose that the current theoretical stalemate may be broken by considering the computational properties of a cortical-subcortical circuit involving the dorsal anterior cingulate cortex (dACC) and the brainstem neuromodulatory nuclei: ventral tegmental area (VTA) and locus coeruleus (LC). From this perspective, the dACC optimizes decisions about stimuli and actions, and using the same computational machinery, it also modulates cortical functions (meta-learning), via neuromodulatory control (VTA and LC). We implemented this theory in a novel neurocomputational model–the Reinforcement Meta Learner (RML). We outline how the RML captures critical empirical findings from an unprecedented range of theoretical domains, and parsimoniously integrates various previous proposals on dACC functioning.},

	abstract = {The study of exploration in the domain of decision making has a long history but remains actively debated. From the vast literature that addressed this topic for decades under various points of view (e.g., developmental psychology, experimental design, artificial intelligence), intrinsic motivation emerged as a concept that can practically be transferred to artificial agents. Especially, in the recent field of Deep Reinforcement Learning (RL), agents implement such a concept (mainly using a novelty argument) in the shape of an exploration bonus, added to the task reward, that encourages visiting the whole environment. This approach is supported by the large amount of theory on RL for which convergence to optimality assumes exhaustive exploration. Yet, Human Beings and mammals do not exhaustively explore the world and their motivation is not only based on novelty but also on various other factors (e.g., curiosity, fun, style, pleasure, safety, competition, etc.). They optimize for life-long learning and train to learn transferable skills in playgrounds without obvious goals. They also apply innate or learned priors to save time and stay safe. For these reasons, we propose to learn an exploration bonus from demonstrations that could transfer these motivations to an artificial agent with little assumptions about their rationale. Using an inverse RL approach, we show that complex exploration behaviors, reflecting different motivations, can be learnt and efficiently used by RL agents to solve tasks for which exhaustive exploration is prohibitive.},

	abstract = {Metacognition is an important component in basic science and clinical psychology, often studied through complex, cognitive experiments. While Signal Detection Theory (SDT) provides a popular and pervasive framework for modelling responses from such experiments, a shortfall remains that it cannot in a straightforward manner account for the often complex designs. Additionally, SDT does not provide direct estimates of metacognitive ability. This latter shortcoming has recently been sought remedied by introduction of a measure for metacognitive sensitivity dubbed meta-d′. The new sensitivity measure, however, further accentuates the need for a flexible modelling framework. In the present paper, we argue that a straightforward extension of SDT is obtained by identifying the model with the proportional odds model, a widely implemented, ordinal regression technique. We go on to develop a formal statistical framework for metacognitive sensitivity by defining a model that combines standard SDT with meta- d′ in a latent variable model. We show how this agrees with the literature on meta-d′ and constitutes a practical framework for extending the model. We supply several theoretical considerations on the model, including closed-form approximate estimates of metad′ and optimal weighing of response-specific meta-sensitivities. We discuss regression analysis as an application of the obtained model and illustrate our points through simulations. Lastly, we discuss a software implementation of the model in R. Our methods and their implementation extend the computational possibilities of SDT and meta- d′ and are useful for theoretical and practical researchers of metacognition.},

	abstract = {Curiosity is pervasive in our everyday lives, but little is known about its underlying mechanisms. In the current study, we assessed whether curiosity about uncertain outcomes is modulated by the valence of the information, i.e. whether the information is good or bad news. Using a lottery task in which outcome uncertainty, expected value and outcome valence (gain versus loss) were manipulated independently, we found that curiosity is overall higher for gains compared with losses. Surprisingly, curiosity increased with increasing outcome uncertainty for both gains and losses, contradicting models that posit that humans seek positive and avoid negative information. Curiosity thus follows from multiple drives, including a drive to improve our world model, as well as, separately, a drive to maximize positive information.},

	abstract = {You probably know what kind of things you are curious about, but can you also explain what it feels like to be curious? Previous studies have demonstrated that we are particularly curious when uncertainty is high and when information provides us with a substantial update of what we know. It is unclear, however, whether this drive to seek information (curiosity) is appetitive or aversive. Curiosity might correspond to an appetitive drive elicited by the state of uncertainty, because we like that state, or rather it might correspond to an aversive drive to reduce the state of uncertainty, because we don’t like it. To investigate this, we obtained both subjective valence (happiness) and curiosity ratings from subjects who performed a lottery task that elicits uncertainty-dependent curiosity. We replicated a strong main effect of outcome uncertainty on curiosity: Curiosity increased with increasing outcome uncertainty, irrespective of whether the outcome represented a monetary gain or loss. By contrast, happiness decreased with higher outcome uncertainty. This indicates that people were more curious, but less happy about lotteries with higher outcome uncertainty. These results demonstrate that curiosity reflects an aversive drive to reduce the unpleasant state of uncertainty.},

	abstract = {This article introduces and formalizes a general class of learning problems for which a developmental learning strategy is shown to be optimal. This class of problems can be explained using the strategic student metaphor: a student has to learn a number of topics (or tasks) to maximize its mean score, and has to choose strategically how to allocate its time among the topics and/or which learning method to use for a given topic. We show that if the performance curves are sub-modular, then a strategy where time allocation or learning method are chosen in a developmental manner is optimal. We argue that this optimal developmental trajectory can be automatically generated by greedy maximization of learning progress. This optimal strategy amounts to creating a structured developmental exploration where typically easy tasks are ﬁrst explored, and then progressively more complicated ones are explored. Furthermore, this result holds independently of the nature of the topics and the learning methods used. Then, we show an algorithm, based on multi-armed bandit techniques, that allows empirical online evaluation of learning progress and approximates the optimal solution. Finally, we show that the strategic student problem formulation allows to view in a common framework many previous approaches to active and developmental learning.},

	abstract = {The notion of optimality is often invoked informally in the literature on metacognitive control. We provide a precise formulation of the optimization problem and show that optimal time allocation strategies depend critically on certain characteristics of the learning environment, such as the extent of time pressure, and the nature of the uptake function. When the learning curve is concave, optimality requires that items at lower levels of initial competence be allocated greater time. On the other hand, with logistic learning curves, optimal allocations vary with time availability in complex and surprising ways. Hence there are conditions under which optimal strategies will be relatively easy to uncover, and others in which suboptimal time allocation might be expected. The model can therefore be used to address the question of whether and when learners should be able to exercise good metacognitive control in practice.},

	abstract = {To best interact with the external world, humans are often required to consider the quality of their actions. Sometimes the environment furnishes rewards or punishments to signal action eﬃcacy. However, when such feedback is absent or only partial, we must rely on internally generated signals to evaluate our performance (i.e., metacognition). Yet, very little is known about how humans form such judgements of sensorimotor conﬁdence. Do they monitor their actual performance or do they rely on cues to sensorimotor uncertainty? We investigated sensorimotor metacognition in two visuomotor tracking experiments, where participants followed an unpredictably moving dot cloud with a mouse cursor as it followed a random horizontal trajectory. Their goal was to infer the underlying target generating the dots, track it for several seconds, and then report their conﬁdence in their tracking as better or worse than their average. In Experiment 1, we manipulated task diﬃculty with two methods: varying the size of the dot cloud and varying the stability of the target's velocity. In Experiment 2, the stimulus statistics were ﬁxed and duration of the stimulus presentation was varied. We found similar levels of metacognitive sensitivity in all experiments, which was evidence against the cue-based strategy. The temporal analysis of metacognitive sensitivity revealed a recency eﬀect, where error later in the trial had a greater inﬂuence on the sensorimotor conﬁdence, consistent with a performance-monitoring strategy. From these results, we conclude that humans predominantly monitored their tracking performance, albeit ineﬃciently, to build a sense of sensorimotor conﬁdence.},

	abstract = {How do we navigate a deeply structured world? Why are you reading this sentence ﬁrst – and did you actually look at the ﬁfth word? This review oﬀers some answers by appealing to active inference based on deep temporal models. It builds on previous formulations of active inference to simulate behavioural and electrophysiological responses under hierarchical generative models of state transitions. Inverting these models corresponds to sequential inference, such that the state at any hierarchical level entails a sequence of transitions in the level below. The deep temporal aspect of these models means that evidence is accumulated over nested time scales, enabling inferences about narratives (i.e., temporal scenes). We illustrate this behaviour with Bayesian belief updating – and neuronal process theories – to simulate the epistemic foraging seen in reading. These simulations reproduce perisaccadic delay period activity and local ﬁeld potentials seen empirically. Finally, we exploit the deep structure of these models to simulate responses to local (e.g., font type) and global (e.g., semantic) violations; reproducing mismatch negativity and P300 responses respectively.},

These models assume that the sensory cortex infers the most likely values of attributes or features of sensory stimuli from the noisy inputs encoding the stimuli. Remarkably, these models describe how this inference could be implemented in a network of very simple computational elements, suggesting that this inference could be performed by biological networks of neurons. Furthermore, learning about the parameters describing the features and their uncertainty is implemented in these models by simple rules of synaptic plasticity based on Hebbian learning. This tutorial introduces the free-energy framework using very simple examples, and provides step-by-step derivations of the model. It also discusses in more detail how the model could be implemented in biological neural circuits. In particular, it presents an extended version of the model in which the neurons only sum their inputs, and synaptic plasticity only depends on activity of pre-synaptic and post-synaptic neurons.},

In fact, tests seem to play little role in the development of learning, because the learning curve is similar even when the number of test trials varies widely (Tulving, Journal of Verbal Learning and Verbal Behavior 6:175–184, 1967). However, this outcome seems odd, because other research has shown that testing fosters greater long-term learning than does studying. We report three experiments addressing whether tests affect the shape of the learning curve. In two of the experiments, we examined this issue by varying the number of spaced study trials in a sequence and examining performance on only a single test trial at the end of the series (a “pure-study” learning curve). We compared these pure-study learning curves to standard learning curves and found that the standard curves increase more rapidly and reach a higher level in both free recall (Exp. 1) and paired-associate learning (Exp. 2). In Experiment 3, we provided additional study trials in the “pure-study” condition to determine whether the standard (study–test) condition would prove superior to a study–study condition. The standard condition still produced better retention on both immediate and delayed tests. Our experiments show that test trials play an important role in the development of learning using both free-recall (Exps. 1 and 3) and pairedassociate (Exp. 2) procedures. Theories of learning have emphasized processes that occur during study, but our results show that processes engaged during tests are also critical.},

	abstract = {Metacognition can be deployed retrospectively (i.e. to reﬂect on the correctness of our recent behaviour) or prospectively (i.e. to make predictions of success in one’s future behaviour or make decisions about strategies to solve future problems). We sought to investigate the factors that determine this sort of prospective decision making in humans. Human participants performed a visual discrimination task followed by ratings of stimulus visibility and response conﬁdence. Prior to each discrimination trial participants made prospective judgments concerning the upcoming task. In Experiment 1, they rated their belief of future success. In Experiment 2, they rated their decision to adopt a focussed attentional state. Both types of prospective decisions were related to behavioural performance in diﬀerent ways. Prospective beliefs of success were associated with no performance changes while prospective decisions to engage attention were followed by better self-evaluation of the correctness of behavioural responses. Using standard machine learning classiﬁers we found that the current prospective decision could be predicted from information concerning task-correctness, stimulus visibility and response conﬁdence from previous trials. In both Experiments, awareness and conﬁdence were more diagnostic of the prospective decision than task correctness. Notably, classiﬁers trained with prospective beliefs of success in Experiment 1 predicted decisions to engage in Experiment 2 and vice-versa. These results indicate that the formation of these seemingly diﬀerent prospective decisions share a common, dynamic representational structure.},

Research on metacognitive judgments, however, clearly indicates that students frequently overestimate their actual performance. Therefore, the present study with N = 209 undergraduate students aimed to support students in developing accurate judgments in order to improve learning processes and, eventually, performance. A quasi-experimental design with three conditions (metacognitive training, testing, and control) and five testing sessions was implemented. In addition to repeated testing plus individual feedback in the testing group, students in the metacognitive training group received psychoeducation, made item-specific judgments, and were given feedback. Over and above the positive effects of repeated testing, metacognitive training positively influenced several monitoring accuracy scores (bias, absolute accuracy, and specificity) and students' performance. Moreover, the metacognitive training group exhibited a nonlinear interindividual decrease in overconfidence. Overall, the study provided considerable evidence that monitoring accuracy and performance can be improved by means of judgment training.},

The current study explores the influence of processing fluency and beliefs on ease-of-learning (EOL) judgments. In two experiments (Exp 1: n = 94; Exp 2: n = 146), participants made EOL judgments on 24 six-letter concrete nouns, presented in either a constant condition (high fluency) with upper-case letters (e.g., BUCKET) or an alternating condition (low fluency) with mixed upper- and lower-case letters (e.g., bUcKeT). After judging words individually, participants studied the words and completed a free recall test. Finally, participants indicated what condition they believed made the words more likely to be learned. Results show constant-condition words were judged as more likely to be learned than alternating condition words, but the difference varied with beliefs. Specifically, the difference was biggest when participants believed the constant condition made words more likely to be learned, followed by believing there was no difference, and then believing the alternating condition made words more likely to be learned. Thus, we showed that processing fluency has a direct effect on EOL judgments, but the effect is moderated by beliefs.},

Several lines of evidence indicate that these two aspects of metacognition are dissociable, suggesting they rely on distinct cues or cognitive resources. However, because prospective and retrospective judgments are often elicited and studied in separate experimental paradigms, their similarities and differences remain unclear. Here we characterize prospective and retrospective judgments of performance in the same perceptual discrimination task using repeated stimuli of constant difﬁculty. Using an incentive-compatible mechanism for eliciting subjective probabilities, subjects expressed their conﬁdence in past choices together with their predictions of success in future choices. We found distinct inﬂuences on each judgment type: retrospective judgments were strongly inﬂuenced by the speed and accuracy of the immediately preceding decision, whereas prospective judgments were inﬂuenced by previous conﬁdence over a longer time window. In contrast, global levels of conﬁdence were correlated across judgments, indicative of a domain-general overconﬁdence that transcends temporal focus.},

Alternatively, conﬁdence is framed in mathematics as an objective statistical quantity: the probability that a chosen hypothesis is correct. Despite similar terminology, it remains unclear whether the subjective feeling of conﬁdence is related to the objective, statistical computation of conﬁdence. To address this, we collected conﬁdence reports from humans performing perceptual and knowledge-based psychometric decision tasks. We observed two counterintuitive patterns relating conﬁdence to choice and evidence: apparent overconﬁdence in choices based on uninformative evidence, and decreasing conﬁdence with increasing evidence strength for erroneous choices. We show that these patterns lawfully arise from statistical conﬁdence, and therefore occur even for perfectly calibrated conﬁdence measures. Furthermore, statistical conﬁdence quantitatively accounted for human conﬁdence in our tasks without necessitating heuristic operations. Accordingly, we suggest that the human feeling of conﬁdence originates from a mental computation of statistical conﬁdence.},

To illustrate these points, we focus our discussion on visual selective attention. It is argued that selectivity in processing has emerged through evolution as a design feature of a complex multi-channel sensorimotor system, which generates selective phenomena of “attention” as one of many by-products. Instead of the traditional analytic approach to attention, we suggest a synthetic approach that starts with well-understood mechanisms that do not need to be dedicated to attention, and yet account for the selectivity phenomena under investigation. We conclude that what would serve scientific progress best would be to drop the term “attention” as a label for a specific functional or neural system and instead focus on behaviorally relevant selection processes and the many systems that implement them.},

We varied the domain of decision making as well as the expected value of the risky prospect. Importantly, no feedback was provided to investigate risk taking and ambiguity aversion independent from learning processes. In a sample of 75 healthy young participants, 55 of whom underwent a stress induction protocol (Trier Social Stress Test for Groups), we observed more risk seeking for gains. This effect was restricted to a subgroup of participants that showed a robust cortisol response to acute stress (n = 26). Gambling under ambiguity, in contrast to gambling under risk, was not inﬂuenced by the cortisol response to stress. These results show that acute psychosocial stress affects economic decision making under risk, independent of learning processes. Our results further point to the importance of cortisol as a mediator of this effect.},

Under risk, the probabilities of different outcomes can be estimated, whereas under ambiguity, even these probabilities are not known. Although most people exhibit at least some aversion to both risk and ambiguity, the degree of these aversions is largely uncorrelated across subjects, suggesting that risk aversion and ambiguity aversion are distinct phenomena. Previous studies have shown differences in brain activations for risky and ambiguous choices and have identified neural mechanisms that may mediate transitions from conditions of ambiguity to conditions of risk. Unknown, however, is whether the value of risky and ambiguous options is necessarily represented by two distinct systems or whether a common mechanism can be identified. To answer this question, we compared the neural representation of subjective value under risk and ambiguity. fMRI was used to track brain activation while subjects made choices regarding options that varied systematically in the amount of money offered and in either the probability of obtaining that amount or the level of ambiguity around that probability. A common system, consisting of at least the striatum and the medial prefrontal cortex, was found to represent subjective value under both conditions.},

Ninety participants between the ages of 7 and 25 completed 40 different puzzles in which they had to intervene on various causal systems to determine their underlying structures. Each puzzle comprised a three- or four-node computer chip with hidden wires. On each trial, participants viewed two possible arrangements of the chip’s hidden wires and had to select a single node to activate. After observing the outcome of their intervention, participants selected a wire conﬁguration and rated their conﬁdence in their selection. We characterized participant choices with a Bayesian measurement model that indexed the extent to which participants selected nodes that would best disambiguate the two possible causal structures versus those that had high causal centrality in one of the two causal hypotheses but did not necessarily discriminate between them. Our model estimates revealed that the use of a discriminatory strategy increased through early adolescence. Further, developmental improvements in intervention strategy were related to changes in the ability to accurately judge the strength of evidence that interventions revealed, as indexed by participants’ conﬁdence in their selections. Our results suggest that improvements in causal information-seeking extend into adolescence and may be driven by metacognitive sensitivity to the efﬁcacy of previous interventions in discriminating competing ideas.},

	abstract = {How do people choose interventions to learn about causal systems? Here, we considered two possibilities. First, we test an information sampling model, information gain, which values interventions that can discriminate between a learner’s hypotheses (i.e. possible causal structures). We compare this discriminatory model to a positive testing strategy that instead aims to conﬁrm individual hypotheses. Experiment 1 shows that individual behavior is described best by a mixture of these two alternatives. In Experiment 2 we ﬁnd that people are able to adaptively alter their behavior and adopt the discriminatory model more often after experiencing that the conﬁrmatory strategy leads to a subjective performance decrement. In Experiment 3, time pressure leads to the opposite effect of inducing a change towards the simpler positive testing strategy. These ﬁndings suggest that there is no single strategy that describes how intervention decisions are made. Instead, people select strategies in an adaptive fashion that trades off their expected performance and cognitive effort.},

Here, adopting a biologically plausible computational framework, we show that intransitive (and thus economically irrational) choices paradoxically improve accuracy (and subsequent economic rewards) when decision formation is corrupted by internal neural noise. Over three experiments, we show that humans accumulate evidence over time using a “selective integration” policy that discards information about alternatives with momentarily lower value. This policy predicts violations of the axiom of transitivity when three equally valued alternatives differ circularly in their number of winning samples. We confirm this prediction in a fourth experiment reporting significant violations of weak stochastic transitivity in human observers. Crucially, we show that relying on selective integration protects choices against “late” noise that otherwise corrupts decision formation beyond the sensory stage. Indeed, we report that individuals with higher late noise relied more strongly on selective integration. These findings suggest that violations of rational choice theory reflect adaptive computations that have evolved in response to irreducible noise during neural information processing.},

We ﬁnd that subjects frequently choose sub-optimal information sources, and that these mistakes can be described by a handful of well-deﬁned decision rules. Most common among these is a conﬁrmation-seeking rule that guides subjects to systematically choose information sources that are biased towards their priors. Analysis of post-experiment survey questions suggest that subjects follow these rules intentionally and ﬁnd them normatively appealing.

This study takes an interdisciplinary perspective, merging computational decision making and developmental approaches to characterize age-related shifts in exploratory strategy from adolescence to young adulthood. Participants were 149 12–28-year-olds who completed a computational explore– exploit paradigm that manipulated reward value, information value, and decision horizon (i.e., the utility that information holds for future choices). Strategic directed exploration, defined as information seeking selective for long time horizons, emerged during adolescence and maintained its level through early adulthood. This age difference was partially driven by adolescents valuing immediate reward over new information. Strategic random exploration, defined as stochastic choice behavior selective for long time horizons, was invoked at comparable levels over the age range, and predicted individual differences in attitudes toward risk taking in daily life within the adolescent portion of the sample. Collectively, these findings reveal an expansion of the diversity of strategic exploration over development, implicate distinct mechanisms for directed and random exploratory strategies, and suggest novel mechanisms for adolescent-typical shifts in decision making.},

In this paper, we hypothesize that an intrinsic motivation to progress in learning is at the origins of the remarkable structure of children’s developmental trajectories. In this view, children engage in exploratory and playful activities for their own sake, not as steps toward other extrinsic goals. The central hypothesis of this paper is that intrinsically motivating activities correspond to expected decrease in prediction error. This motivation system pushes the infant to avoid both predictable and unpredictable situations in order to focus on the ones that are expected to maximize progress in learning. Based on a computational model and a series of robotic experiments, we show how this principle can lead to organized sequences of behavior of increasing complexity characteristic of several behavioral and developmental patterns observed in humans. We then discuss the putative circuitry underlying such an intrinsic motivation system in the brain and formulate two novel hypotheses. The ﬁrst one is that tonic dopamine acts as a learning progress signal. The second is that this progress signal is directly computed through a hierarchy of microcortical circuits that act both as prediction and metaprediction systems.},

	abstract = {Current theories propose that our sense of curiosity is determined by the learning progress or information gain that our cognitive system expects to make. However, few studies have explicitly tried to quantify subjective information gain and link it to measures of curiosity. Here, we asked people to report their curiosity about the intrinsically engaging perceptual ‘puzzles’ known as Mooney images, and to report on the strength of their aha experience upon revealing the solution image (curiosity relief). We also asked our participants (279) to make a guess concerning the solution of the image, and used the distribution of these guesses to compute the crowdsourced semantic entropy (or ambiguity) of the images, as a measure of the potential for information gain. Our results confirm that curiosity and, even more so, aha experience is substantially associated with this semantic information gain measure. These findings support the expected information gain theory of curiosity and suggest that the aha experience or intrinsic reward is driven by the actual information gain. In an unannounced memory part, we also established that the often reported influence of curiosity on memory is fully mediated by the aha experience or curiosity relief. We discuss the implications of our results for the burgeoning fields of curiosity and psychoaesthetics.},

	abstract = {A wealth of research focuses on the decision-making processes that animals and humans employ when selecting actions in the face of reward and punishment. Initially such work stemmed from psychological investigations of conditioned behavior, and explanations of these in terms of computational models. Increasingly, analysis at the computational level has drawn on ideas from reinforcement learning, which provide a normative framework within which decision-making can be analyzed. More recently, the fruits of these extensive lines of research have made contact with investigations into the neural basis of decision making. Converging evidence now links reinforcement learning to specific neural substrates, assigning them precise computational roles. Specifically, electrophysiological recordings in behaving animals and functional imaging of human decision-making have revealed in the brain the existence of a key reinforcement learning signal, the temporal difference reward prediction error. Here, we first introduce the formal reinforcement learning framework. We then review the multiple lines of evidence linking reinforcement learning to the function of dopaminergic neurons in the mammalian midbrain and to more recent data from human imaging experiments. We further extend the discussion to aspects of learning not associated with phasic dopamine signals, such as learning of goal-directed responding that may not be dopamine-dependent, and learning about the vigor (or rate) with which actions should be performed that has been linked to tonic aspects of dopaminergic signaling. We end with a brief discussion of some of the limitations of the reinforcement learning framework, highlighting questions for future research.},

	abstract = {Devising efﬁcient strategies for exploration in large open-ended spaces is one of the most difﬁcult computational problems of intelligent organisms. Because the available rewards are ambiguous or unknown during the exploratory phase, subjects must act in intrinsically motivated fashion. However, a vast majority of behavioral and neural studies to date have focused on decision making in reward-based tasks, and the rules guiding intrinsically motivated exploration remain largely unknown. To examine this question we developed a paradigm for systematically testing the choices of human observers in a free play context. Adult subjects played a series of short computer games of variable difﬁculty, and freely choose which game they wished to sample without external guidance or physical rewards. Subjects performed the task in three distinct conditions where they sampled from a small or a large choice set (7 vs. 64 possible levels of difﬁculty), and where they did or did not have the possibility to sample new games at a constant level of difﬁculty. We show that despite the absence of external constraints, the subjects spontaneously adopted a structured exploration strategy whereby they (1) started with easier games and progressed to more difﬁcult games, (2) sampled the entire choice set including extremely difﬁcult games that could not be learnt, (3) repeated moderately and high difﬁculty games much more frequently than was predicted by chance, and (4) had higher repetition rates and chose higher speeds if they could generate new sequences at a constant level of difﬁculty. The results suggest that intrinsically motivated exploration is shaped by several factors including task difﬁculty, novelty and the size of the choice set, and these come into play to serve two internal goals—maximize the subjects’ knowledge of the available tasks (exploring the limits of the task set), and maximize their competence (performance and skills) across the task set.},

However, while saccadic decisions are intensively investigated in instrumental contexts where saccades guide subsequent actions, it is largely unknown how they may be inﬂuenced by curiosity – the intrinsic desire to learn. While saccades are sensitive to visual novelty and visual surprise, no study has examined their relation to epistemic curiosity – interest in symbolic, semantic information. To investigate this question, we tracked the eye movements of human observers while they read trivia questions and, after a brief delay, were visually given the answer. We show that higher curiosity was associated with earlier anticipatory orienting of gaze toward the answer location without changes in other metrics of saccades or ﬁxations, and that these inﬂuences were distinct from those produced by variations in conﬁdence and surprise. Across subjects, the enhancement of anticipatory gaze was correlated with measures of trait curiosity from personality questionnaires. Finally, a machine learning algorithm could predict curiosity in a cross-subject manner, relying primarily on statistical features of the gaze position before the answer onset and independently of covariations in conﬁdence or surprise, suggesting potential practical applications for educational technologies, recommender systems and research in cognitive sciences.

	abstract = {Curiosity is considered to be the essence of science and an integral component of cognition. What prompts curiosity in a learner? Previous theoretical accounts of curiosity remain divided—novelty-based theories propose that new and highly uncertain stimuli pique curiosity, whereas complexity-based theories propose that stimuli with an intermediate degree of uncertainty stimulate curiosity. In this article, we present a rational analysis of curiosity by considering the computational problem underlying curiosity, which allows us to model these distinct accounts of curiosity in a common framework. Our approach posits that a rational agent should explore stimuli that maximally increase the usefulness of its knowledge and that curiosity is the mechanism by which humans approximate this rational behavior. Critically, our analysis show that the causal structure of the environment can determine whether curiosity is driven by either highly uncertain or moderately uncertain stimuli. This suggests that previous theories need not be in contention but are special cases of a more general account of curiosity. Experimental results confirm our predictions and demonstrate that our theory explains a wide range of findings about human curiosity, including its subjectivity and malleability.},

	abstract = {We introduce a new, efficient, principled and backpropagation-compatible algorithm for learning a probability distribution on the weights of a neural network, called Bayes by Backprop. It regularises the weights by minimising a compression cost, known as the variational free energy or the expected lower bound on the marginal likelihood. We show that this principled kind of regularisation yields comparable performance to dropout on MNIST classification. We then demonstrate how the learnt uncertainty in the weights can be used to improve generalisation in non-linear regression problems, and how this weight uncertainty can be used to drive the exploration-exploitation trade-off in reinforcement learning.},

Our analysis evaluated theoretically motivated potential predictors of certainty to determine how well each predicted participants’ subjective reports of certainty. Regression analyses that controlled for individual differences demonstrated that despite learning curves tracking the ideal learning models, reported certainty was best explained by performance rather than measures derived from a learning model. In particular, participants’ confidence was driven primarily by how well they observed themselves doing, not by idealized statistical inferences made from the data they observed.},

	abstract = {The central tenet of reinforcement learning (RL) is that agents seek to maximize the sum of cumulative rewards. In contrast, active inference, an emerging framework within cognitive and computational neuroscience, proposes that agents act to maximize the evidence for a biased generative model. Here, we illustrate how ideas from active inference can augment traditional RL approaches by (i) furnishing an inherent balance of exploration and exploitation, and (ii) providing a more ﬂexible conceptualization of reward. Inspired by active inference, we develop and implement a novel objective for decision making, which we term the free energy of the expected future. We demonstrate that the resulting algorithm successfully balances exploration and exploitation, simultaneously achieving robust performance on several challenging RL benchmarks with sparse, well-shaped, and no rewards.},

	abstract = {Many large and small decisions we make in our daily lives—which ice cream to choose, what research projects to pursue, which partner to marry—require an exploration of alternatives before committing to and exploiting the benefits of a particular choice. Furthermore, many decisions require re-evaluation, and further exploration of alternatives, in the face of changing needs or circumstances. That is, often our decisions depend on a higher level choice: whether to exploit well known but possibly suboptimal alternatives or to explore risky but potentially more profitable ones. How adaptive agents choose between exploitation and exploration remains an important and open question that has received relatively limited attention in the behavioural and brain sciences. The choice could depend on a number of factors, including the familiarity of the environment, how quickly the environment is likely to change and the relative value of exploiting known sources of reward versus the cost of reducing uncertainty through exploration. There is no known generally optimal solution to the exploration versus exploitation problem, and a solution to the general case may indeed not be possible. However, there have been formal analyses of the optimal policy under constrained circumstances. There have also been specific suggestions of how humans and animals may respond to this problem under particular experimental conditions as well as proposals about the brain mechanisms involved. Here, we provide a brief review of this work, discuss how exploration and exploitation may be mediated in the brain and highlight some promising future directions for research.},

In a Bayesian statistical framework, optimal inference and prediction, based on unreliable observations in changing contexts, require the representation and manipulation of different forms of uncertainty. We propose that the neuromodulators acetylcholine and norepinephrine play a major role in the brain’s implementation of these uncertainty computations. Acetylcholine signals expected uncertainty, coming from known unreliability of predictive cues within a context. Norepinephrine signals unexpected uncertainty, as when unsignaled context switches produce strongly unexpected observations. These uncertainty signals interact to enable optimal inference and learning in noisy and changeable environments. This formulation is consistent with a wealth of physiological, pharmacological, and behavioral data implicating acetylcholine and norepinephrine in specific aspects of a range of cognitive processes. Moreover, the model suggests a class of attentional cueing tasks that involve both neuromodulators and shows how their interactions may be part-antagonistic, part-synergistic.},

These metacognitive abilities help people to avoid making the same mistakes twice, and to avoid overcommitting time or resources to decisions that are based on unreliable evidence. In this review, we consider progress in characterizing the neural and mechanistic basis of these related aspects of metacognition—confidence judgements and error monitoring—and identify crucial points of convergence between methods and theories in the two fields. This convergence suggests that common principles govern metacognitive judgements of confidence and accuracy; in particular, a shared reliance on post-decisional processing within the systems responsible for the initial decision. However, research in both fields has focused rather narrowly on simple, discrete decisions—reflecting the correspondingly restricted focus of current models of the decision process itself—raising doubts about the degree to which discovered principles will scale up to explain metacognitive evaluation of real-world decisions and actions that are fluid, temporally extended, and embedded in the broader context of evolving behavioural goals.},

Here, we created conditions in a perceptual decision task that were matched in accuracy but differed in subjective evaluation of accuracy by orthogonally varying the strength versus variability of evidence. Confidence was reduced with variable (vs. weak) evidence, even across conditions matched for difficulty. Building on this dissociation, we constructed a paradigm in which participants (N = 20) could choose to seek further information before making their decision. The data provided clear support for the hypothesis that subjective confidence predicts information seeking in decision making: Participants were more likely to sample additional information before giving a response in the condition with low confidence, despite matched accuracy. In a preregistered replication (N = 50), these findings were replicated with increased task difficulty levels.},

	abstract = {Any adaptive organism faces the choice between taking actions with known benefits (exploitation), and sampling new actions to check for other, more valuable opportunities available (exploration). The latter involves informationseeking, a drive so fundamental to learning and long-term reward that it can reasonably be considered, through evolution or development, to have acquired its own value, independent of immediate reward. Similarly, behaviors that fail to yield information may have come to be associated with aversive experiences such as boredom, demotivation, and task disengagement. In accord with these suppositions, we propose that boredom reflects an adaptive signal for managing the exploration-exploitation tradeoff, in the service of optimizing information acquisition and long-term reward. We tested participants in three experiments, manipulating the information content in their immediate task environment, and showed that increased perceptions of boredom arise in environments in which there is little useful information, and that higher boredom correlates with higher exploration. These findings are the first step toward a model formalizing the relationship between exploration, exploitation and boredom.},

One important principle regards the distinction between declarative and procedural knowledge, between knowing that and knowing how. Declarative knowledge is considered here not as an alternative kind of knowledge, as is usually the case in theories of memory, but as part of procedural knowledge. In our view this leads to another approach with respect to the distinction. Declarative knowledge has occupied more attention in (cognitive) psychological research than can be justified on the basis of the importance of procedural knowledge for behavior. We also discuss the question whether there are other brain faculties that reflect the same organizational characteristics.

We studied one aspect of curiosity by measuring exploratory eye movements in response to provocative visual stimuli in 12 patients with probable AD and 10 matched controls. Subjects viewed slides, each of which contained an incongruous or irregular figure paired with a congruous or regular one. Unlike controls, who spent significantly more time viewing the incongruous stimuli, AD patients distributed their viewing time equally and spent significantly less time than controls looking at the novel stimuli. Additionally, when presented with picture slides containing an unexpected element, AD patients exhibited diminished visual exploration overall and decreased attention to the incongruous part. Further analyses suggest that the results cannot be adequately explained by a general decline in cognition or by problems with ocular motility or directing visual attention.

	abstract = {Acetylcholine (ACh) has a crucial role in the peripheral and central nervous 
systems. The enzyme choline acetyltransferase (ChAT) is responsible for 
synthesizing ACh from acetyl-CoA and choline in the cytoplasm and the vesicular 
acetylcholine transporter (VAChT) uptakes the neurotransmitter into synaptic 
vesicles. Following depolarization, ACh undergoes exocytosis reaching the 
synaptic cleft, where it can bind its receptors, including muscarinic and 
nicotinic receptors. ACh present at the synaptic cleft is promptly hydrolyzed by 
the enzyme acetylcholinesterase (AChE), forming acetate and choline, which is 
recycled into the presynaptic nerve terminal by the high-affinity choline 
transporter (CHT1). Cholinergic neurons located in the basal forebrain, 
including the neurons that form the nucleus basalis of Meynert, are severely 
lost in Alzheimer’s disease (AD). AD is the most ordinary cause of dementia 
affecting 25 million people worldwide. The hallmarks of the disease are the 
accumulation of neurofibrillary tangles and amyloid plaques. However, there is 
no real correlation between levels of cortical plaques and AD-related cognitive 
impairment. Nevertheless, synaptic loss is the principal correlate of disease 
progression and loss of cholinergic neurons contributes to memory and attention 
deficits. Thus, drugs that act on the cholinergic system represent a promising 
option to treat AD patients.},

Dog-rearing experiments indicate that "dogs reared in isolation showed none of the physical debility and susceptibility to infection that Spitz reported." Dogs whose patterns of exteroceptive stimulation were restricted were markedly atypical in a number of performances. A finding based on "brainwashing" by Chinese communists in the Korean War is that: "Without physical pain, without drugs, the personality can be badly deformed simply by modifying the perceptual environment." In an experiment with sensory isolation for the human there were hallucinations, disturbances in the selfpercept, impairment of intelligence test performance, changes in EEG, and marked visual disturbances on first emerging from isolation. "With the possible exception of the effects of propaganda, the changes were reversible, disappearing in a day or so." Making isolation more drastic produces motivational and emotional disturbances much more quickly. "Clearly man's motivation is a function of his exteroceptive stimulation."

	shorttitle = {Allostasis},
	doi = {10.1016/j.physbeh.2011.06.004},
	abstract = {The premise of the standard regulatory model, "homeostasis", is flawed: the goal of regulation is not to preserve constancy of the internal milieu. Rather, it is to continually adjust the milieu to promote survival and reproduction. Regulatory mechanisms need to be efficient, but homeostasis (error-correction by feedback) is inherently inefficient. Thus, although feedbacks are certainly ubiquitous, they could not possibly serve as the primary regulatory mechanism. A newer model, "allostasis", proposes that efficient regulation requires anticipating needs and preparing to satisfy them before they arise. The advantages: (i) errors are reduced in magnitude and frequency; (ii) response capacities of different components are matched -- to prevent bottlenecks and reduce safety factors; (iii) resources are shared between systems to minimize reserve capacities; (iv) errors are remembered and used to reduce future errors. This regulatory strategy requires a dedicated organ, the brain. The brain tracks multitudinous variables and integrates their values with prior knowledge to predict needs and set priorities. The brain coordinates effectors to mobilize resources from modest bodily stores and enforces a system of flexible trade-offs: from each organ according to its ability, to each organ according to its need. The brain also helps regulate the internal milieu by governing anticipatory behavior. Thus, an animal conserves energy by moving to a warmer place - before it cools, and it conserves salt and water by moving to a cooler one before it sweats. The behavioral strategy requires continuously updating a set of specific "shopping lists" that document the growing need for each key component (warmth, food, salt, water). These appetites funnel into a common pathway that employs a "stick" to drive the organism toward filling the need, plus a "carrot" to relax the organism when the need is satisfied. The stick corresponds broadly to the sense of anxiety, and the carrot broadly to the sense of pleasure. This design constrains anxieties to be non-adapting and pleasures to be brief -- fast-adapting -- to make way for the next anxiety. The stick/carrot mechanisms evolved early and expanded so that in humans they govern higher level learning and social organization. Correspondingly, the "funnel" widened to allow innumerable activities and experiences to each provide non-adapting anxieties and brief pleasures, their reward values depending partly on the effort expended. But modern life narrows the variety of small pleasures and reduces effort, thereby reducing their reward value and requiring larger portions for equivalent satisfaction - a cycle that generates addictive behaviors. Homeostasis and allostasis locate pathology at different levels. Homeostasis identifies proximate causes; for example, it attributes essential hypertension to excess salt water in too small a vascular reservoir. Thus it directs pharmacotherapy toward reducing salt and water, expanding the reservoir, and blocking feedbacks that would counteract these measures. Allostasis attributes essential hypertension to the brain. Chronically anticipating a need for higher pressure, the brain mobilizes all the low level mechanisms in concert: kidney to retain salt and water, vascular system to tighten, and salt appetite to rise. Correspondingly, allostasis would direct therapy toward higher levels - to reduce demand and increase sense of control -- so that the brain can down-shift its prediction and relax all the low-level mechanisms in concert. For disorders of addiction homeostasis pursues pharmacological treatments: drugs to treat drug addiction, obesity, and other compulsive behaviors. Allostasis suggests broader approaches - such as re-expanding the range of possible pleasures and providing opportunities to expend effort in their pursuit.},

Attention is easily engaged with surprising events, leading to long dwell times.

This review summarizes different lines of research relevant to the proposed surprise-attention link: shifts of attention as indexed by accuracy gains and efficiency gains, validity effects, shifts of gaze, discrepancies in natural scenes, surprise-induced blindness, and action interruption. It is argued that there is convergent evidence for the surprise-attention link in general, and for the particular hypothesis that the underlying mechanism constantly tests expectancies on different levels of representation. Evidence also converges on a latency of an attentional engagement of nearly 400 ms. This seems to be a unique feature of surprise capture that also questions the validity of models proposing that saliency is an early automatic attractor of attention. Mechanisms possibly underlying the surprise-attention link are discussed.},

Previous theoretical accounts of curiosity remain divided—novelty-based theories propose that new and highly uncertain stimuli pique curiosity, whereas complexity-based theories propose that stimuli with an intermediate degree of uncertainty stimulate curiosity. In this article, we present a rational analysis of curiosity by considering the computational problem underlying curiosity, which allows us to model these distinct accounts of curiosity in a common framework. Our approach posits that a rational agent should explore stimuli that maximally increase the usefulness of its knowledge and that curiosity is the mechanism by which humans approximate this rational behavior. Critically, our analysis show that the causal structure of the environment can determine whether curiosity is driven by either highly uncertain or moderately uncertain stimuli. This suggests that previous theories need not be in contention but are special cases of a more general account of curiosity. Experimental results confirm our predictions and demonstrate that our theory explains a wide range of findings about human curiosity, including its subjectivity and malleability.},

	doi = {10.1007/s00213-006-0578-x},
	abstract = {INTRODUCTION: Debate continues over the precise causal contribution made by mesolimbic dopamine systems to reward. There are three competing explanatory categories: 'liking', learning, and 'wanting'. Does dopamine mostly mediate the hedonic impact of reward ('liking')? Does it instead mediate learned predictions of future reward, prediction error teaching signals and stamp in associative links (learning)? Or does dopamine motivate the pursuit of rewards by attributing incentive salience to reward-related stimuli ('wanting')? Each hypothesis is evaluated here, and it is suggested that the incentive salience or 'wanting' hypothesis of dopamine function may be consistent with more evidence than either learning or 'liking'. In brief, recent evidence indicates that dopamine is neither necessary nor sufficient to mediate changes in hedonic 'liking' for sensory pleasures. Other recent evidence indicates that dopamine is not needed for new learning, and not sufficient to directly mediate learning by causing teaching or prediction signals. By contrast, growing evidence indicates that dopamine does contribute causally to incentive salience. Dopamine appears necessary for normal 'wanting', and dopamine activation can be sufficient to enhance cue-triggered incentive salience. Drugs of abuse that promote dopamine signals short circuit and sensitize dynamic mesolimbic mechanisms that evolved to attribute incentive salience to rewards. Such drugs interact with incentive salience integrations of Pavlovian associative information with physiological state signals. That interaction sets the stage to cause compulsive 'wanting' in addiction, but also provides opportunities for experiments to disentangle 'wanting', 'liking', and learning hypotheses. Results from studies that exploited those opportunities are described here.
CONCLUSION: In short, dopamine's contribution appears to be chiefly to cause 'wanting' for hedonic rewards, more than 'liking' or learning for those rewards.},

Ventral tegmental area (VTA) and Locus Coeruleus (LC) are canonically described as the main sources of dopamine (DA) and noradrenaline (NA) with dissociate functions. A comparison of diverse studies shows that these neuromodulators largely overlap in multiple domains such as shared biosynthetic pathway and co-release from the LC terminals, convergent innervations, non-specificity of receptors and transporters, and shared intracellular signaling pathways. DA–NA interactions are mainly studied in prefrontal cortex and hippocampus, yet it can be extended to the whole brain given the diversity of catecholamine innervations. LC can simultaneously broadcast both dopamine and noradrenaline across the brain. Here, we briefly review the molecular, cellular, and physiological overlaps between DA and NA systems and point to their functional implications. We suggest that DA and NA may function in parallel to facilitate learning and maintain the states required for normal cognitive processes. Various signaling modules of NA and DA have been targeted for developing of therapeutics. Understanding overlaps of the two systems is crucial for more effective interventions in a range of neuropsychiatric conditions.},

We provide a survey of the diverse HRL approaches concerning the challenges of learning hierarchical policies, subtask discovery, transfer learning, and multi-agent learning using HRL. The survey is presented according to a novel taxonomy of the approaches. Based on the survey, a set of important open problems is proposed to motivate the future research in HRL. Furthermore, we outline a few suitable task domains for evaluating the HRL approaches and a few interesting examples of the practical applications of HRL in the Supplementary Material.},

	abstract = {A central problem in motor control is understanding how the many biomechanical degrees of freedom are coordinated to achieve a common goal. An especially puzzling aspect of coordination is that behavioral goals are achieved reliably and repeatedly with movements rarely reproducible in their detail. Existing theoretical frameworks emphasize either goal achievement or the richness of motor variability, but fail to reconcile the two. Here we propose an alternative theory based on stochastic optimal feedback control. We show that the optimal strategy in the face of uncertainty is to allow variability in redundant (task-irrelevant) dimensions. This strategy does not enforce a desired trajectory, but uses feedback more intelligently, correcting only those deviations that interfere with task goals. From this framework, task-constrained variability, goal-directed corrections, motor synergies, controlled parameters, simplifying rules and discrete coordination modes emerge naturally. We present experimental results from a range of motor tasks to support this theory.},

	abstract = {How do people monitor the correctness of their answers? A self-consistency model is proposed for the process underlying confidence judgments and their accuracy. In answering a 2-alternative question, participants are assumed to retrieve a sample of representations of the question and base their confidence on the consistency with which the chosen answer is supported across representations. Confidence is modeled by analogy to the calculation of statistical level of confidence (SLC) in testing hypotheses about a population and represents the participant’s assessment of the likelihood that a new sample will yield the same choice. Assuming that participants draw representations from a commonly shared item-specific population of representations, predictions were derived regarding the function relating confidence to inter-participant consensus and intra-participant consistency for the more preferred (majority) and the less preferred (minority) choices. The predicted pattern was confirmed for several different tasks. The confidence–accuracy relationship was shown to be a by-product of the consistency– correctness relationship: It is positive because the answers that are consistently chosen are generally correct, but negative when the wrong answers tend to be favored. The overconfidence bias stems from the reliability–validity discrepancy: Confidence monitors reliability (or self-consistency), but its accuracy is evaluated in calibration studies against correctness. Simulation and empirical results suggest that response speed is a frugal cue for self-consistency, and its validity depends on the validity of self-consistency in predicting performance. Another mnemonic cue—accessibility, which is the overall amount of information that comes to mind—makes an added, independent contribution. Self-consistency and accessibility may correspond to the 2 parameters that affect SLC: sample variance and sample size.},

Answers that are on the tip-of-the-tongue (TOT)—not immediately recallable but nevertheless evoking a feeling of imminent recall—seem, intuitively, to be materials that have this characteristic of being almost, but not quite, fully known. We therefore, hypothesized that people would be particularly curious to see the answers to questions for which the answers were on the tips of their tongues. To test the TOT curiosity hypothesis, we gave participants 82 general information questions and quickly asked whether the answers were or were not on the tips of their tongues and whether they wanted to see the answers later. Overwhelmingly, items that were accompanied by a TOT feeling were those which evoked participants’ curiosity, regardless of whether the feeling occurred in conjunction with an error of commission, an error of omission, or even with the correct answer.},

Experimental investigations indicate that errorful learning followed by corrective feedback is beneﬁcial to learning. Interestingly, the beneﬁcial effects are particularly salient when individuals strongly believe that their error is correct: Errors committed with high conﬁdence are corrected more readily than low-conﬁdence errors. Corrective feedback, including analysis of the reasoning leading up to the mistake, is crucial. Aside from the direct beneﬁt to learners, teachers gain valuable information from errors, and error tolerance encourages students’ active, exploratory, generative engagement. If the goal is optimal performance in high-stakes situations, it may be worthwhile to allow and even encourage students to commit and correct errors while they are in low-stakes learning situations rather than to assiduously avoid errors at all costs.},

Previous theoretical accounts of curiosity remain divided—novelty-based theories propose that new and highly uncertain stimuli pique curiosity, whereas complexity-based theories propose that stimuli with an intermediate degree of uncertainty stimulate curiosity. In this article, we present a rational analysis of curiosity by considering the computational problem underlying curiosity, which allows us to model these distinct accounts of curiosity in a common framework. Our approach posits that a rational agent should explore stimuli that maximally increase the usefulness of its knowledge and that curiosity is the mechanism by which humans approximate this rational behavior. Critically, our analysis show that the causal structure of the environment can determine whether curiosity is driven by either highly uncertain or moderately uncertain stimuli. This suggests that previous theories need not be in contention but are special cases of a more general account of curiosity. Experimental results confirm our predictions and demonstrate that our theory explains a wide range of findings about human curiosity, including its subjectivity and malleability.},

This finding led to a behavioral study, which showed that subjects spent more scarce resources (either limited tokens or waiting time) to find out answers when they were more curious. The functional imaging also showed that curiosity increased activity in memory areas when subjects guessed incorrectly, which suggests that curiosity may enhance memory for surprising new information.

Learning is best predicted by both curiosity and an objective measure of knowledge. These results suggest that while curiosity is correlated with knowledge, there is only a small boost in learning from being curious.

Nevertheless, its nature, dimensionality, and determinants all remain surprisingly poorly understood. While there is general agreement on a “broad strokes” understanding of curiosity as a desire for new knowledge, the precise character of that desire and the specific behaviors it may motivate continue to spark considerable disagreement and debate. In this chapter, I discuss both previous and contemporary theory and research on curiosity as a psychological construct. I describe curiosity in terms of two types: D-­type and I-­type. D-t­ype curiosity is theorized to reflect an uncomfortable “need to know” that becomes increasingly bothersome until satisfied by obtaining the desired specific pieces of missing information. I-­type curiosity is theorized to be a more relaxed “take it or leave it” attitude towards the discovery of new information, in which the aim is simply to have fun while learning. Qualitative differences between I-­type and D-t­ype curiosity ­experiences – being motivated either to induce situational interest or reduce situational uncertainty, respectively – are hypothesized to translate into significant quantifiable differences in the extent to which each type of curiosity energizes behavior. Specifically, D-­type curiosity is hypothesized to be associated with both more intense levels of state-­curiosity and greater persistence in subsequent information-seeking behavior as compared to I-­type curiosity. Finally, future directions for research are discussed.},

	title = {Curiosity in schools},
	abstract = {Curiosity is essential for scientific discovery and innovation [1, 2] and, more universally, is a natural and irrepressible characteristic of young children [3, 4, 5]. Yet it is also sometimes considered maladaptive in its influence later in development [6]. In the U. S. education system, which is now heavily focused on students meeting fixed standards and performing well on standardized tests, curiosity can actually create a type of risk for teachers, insofar as it threatens performance toward these rigid goals [5]. While curiosity and learning have traditionally been viewed as symbiotic, there are ample reasons to be concerned that our current education system suppresses rather than promotes students’ natural curiosity. Why does this inconsistency exist? What would curiosity-promoting educational practice look like, and how does this differ from what happens more typically in classrooms? In this chapter, we explore these questions. After a brief review of why curiosity should be a priority in education, we discuss how curiosity might be promoted or suppressed in educational settings based on prior research, what curiosity in classrooms might look like, and how research on curiosity can be applied to educational settings. We will focus on the process of qualitatively observing educational practice and linking the observations to this prior work to identify ways of influencing students’ preferences for uncertainty. We will then shift direction to argue for the need to study curiosity in classrooms and naturalistic learning environments, and the difficulty in doing this if curiosity is understood and studied as a unitary, independent construct. We end with potential future directions to bridge and broaden research on curiosity for educational application.},

The article is in part an historical review and in part a tutorial, reviewing the probabilistic Bayesian approach to understanding perception and how it may be shaped by context, and also reviewing ideas about how such probabilistic computations may be carried out in neural networks, focusing on the role of context in interactive neural networks, in which both bottom-up and top-down signals affect the interpretation of sensory inputs. It is pointed out that connectionist units that use the logistic or softmax activation functions can exactly compute Bayesian posterior probabilities when the bias terms and connection weights affecting such units are set to the logarithms of appropriate probabilistic quantities. Bayesian concepts such the prior, likelihood, (joint and marginal) posterior, probability matching and maximizing, and calculating vs. sampling from the posterior are all reviewed and linked to neural network computations. Probabilistic and neural network models are explicitly linked to the concept of a probabilistic generative model that describes the relationship between the underlying target of perception (e.g., the word intended by a speaker or other source of sensory stimuli) and the sensory input that reaches the perceiver for use in inferring the underlying target. It is shown how a new version of the IA model called the multinomial interactive activation (MIA) model can sample correctly from the joint posterior of a proposed generative model for perception of letters in words, indicating that interactive processing is fully consistent with principled probabilistic computation. Ways in which these computations might be realized in real neural systems are also considered.},

Although it often serves an adaptive role, extreme anxiety that is disproportionate to the actual presence or likelihood of threat can cause distress and suffering for individuals with clinical anxiety disorders.We propose a new model, called the 'uncertainty and anticipation model of anxiety' (UAMA), which emphasizes five processes explaining why uncertainty about future threat is so disruptive in anxiety. These five processes are inflated estimates of threat cost and probability, increased threat attention and hypervigilance, deficient safety learning, behavioural and cognitive avoidance and heightened reactivity to threat uncertainty. The neural circuitry for each of the five UAMA processes promotes an adaptive role in responding to and reducing uncertainty about threat.However, alterations in that neural circuitry result in maladaptive responses to uncertainty in pathological anxiety.The key brain regions implicated in maladaptive responses to uncertainty in anxiety include the amygdala, bed nucleus of the stria terminalis, ventromedial prefrontal cortex, orbitofrontal cortex, dorsomedial and dorsolateral prefrontal cortex and anterior insula.The anterior mid-cingulate cortex, which is heavily interconnected with each of these brain regions, shows consistent functional and structural abnormalities in clinical anxiety. We propose a central role for this region in contributing to an array of maladaptive responses to uncertainty.In focusing the experimental and theoretical literatures through the common lens of uncertainty, this perspective provides a unifying theme that binds together many diverse features of clinical anxiety and thus provides a conceptual framework for advancing future research on the neurobiology of anxiety disorders.},

	abstract = {The motivation to seek out and consume rewards has evolutionarily been driven by the urge to fulfill physiological needs. However in a modern society dominated more by plenty than scarcity, we tend to think of motivation as fueled by the search for pleasure. Here, we argue that two separate but interconnected subcortical and unconscious processes direct motivation: “wanting” and “liking.” These two psychological and neuronal processes and their related brain structures typically work together, but can become dissociated, particularly in cases of addiction. In drug addiction, for example, repeated consumption of addictive drugs sensitizes the mesolimbic dopamine system, the primary component of the “wanting” system, resulting in excessive “wanting” for drugs and their cues. This sensitizing process is long-lasting and occurs independently of the “liking” system, which typically remains unchanged or may develop a blunted pleasure response to the drug. The result is excessive drug-taking despite minimal pleasure and intense cue-triggered craving that may promote relapse long after detoxification. Here, we describe the roles of “liking” and “wanting” in general motivation and review recent evidence for a dissociation of “liking” and “wanting” in drug addiction, known as the incentive sensitization theory (Robinson and Berridge 1993). We also make the case that sensitization of the “wanting” system and the resulting dissociation of “liking” and “wanting” occurs in both gambling disorder and food addiction.},

	abstract = {This review takes a historical perspective on concepts in the psychology of motivation and emotion, and surveys recent developments, debates and applications. Old debates over emotion have recently risen again. For example, are emotions necessarily subjective feelings? Do animals have emotions? I review evidence that emotions exist as core psychological processes, which have objectively detectable features, and which can occur either with subjective feelings or without them. Evidence is offered also that studies of emotion in animals can give new insights into human emotions. Beyond emotion, motivation concepts have changed over decades too, and debates still continue. Motivation was once thought in terms of aversive drives, and reward was thought of in terms of drive reduction. Motivation-as-drive concepts were largely replaced by motivation-as-incentive concepts, yet aversive drive concepts still occasionally surface in reward neuroscience today. Among incentive concepts, incentive salience is a core motivation process, mediated by brain mesocorticolimbic systems (dopamine-related systems) and sometimes called ‘wanting’ (in quotation marks), to distinguish it from cognitive forms of desire (wanting without quotation marks). Incentive salience as ‘wanting’ is separable also from pleasure ‘liking’ for the same reward, which has important implications for several human clinical disorders. Ordinarily, incentive salience adds motivational urgency to cognitive desires, but ‘wanting’ and cognitive desires can dissociate in some conditions. Excessive incentive salience can cause addictions, in which excessive ‘wanting’ can diverge from cognitive desires. Conversely, lack of incentive salience may cause motivational forms of anhedonia in depression or schizophrenia, whereas a negatively-valenced form of ‘fearful salience’ may contribute to paranoia. Finally, negative ‘fear’ and ‘disgust’ have both partial overlap but also important neural differences.},

	abstract = {Rationale
Uncertainty tolerance (UT) is an important, well-studied phenomenon in health care and many other important domains of life, yet its conceptualization and measurement by researchers in various disciplines have varied substantially and its essential nature remains unclear.
Objective
The objectives of this study were to: 1) analyze the meaning and logical coherence of UT as conceptualized by developers of UT measures, and 2) develop an integrative conceptual model to guide future empirical research regarding the nature, causes, and effects of UT.
Methods
A narrative review and conceptual analysis of 18 existing measures of Uncertainty and Ambiguity Tolerance was conducted, focusing on how measure developers in various fields have defined both the “uncertainty” and “tolerance” components of UT—both explicitly through their writings and implicitly through the items constituting their measures.
Results
Both explicit and implicit conceptual definitions of uncertainty and tolerance vary substantially and are often poorly and inconsistently specified. A logically coherent, unified understanding or theoretical model of UT is lacking. To address these gaps, we propose a new integrative definition and multidimensional conceptual model that construes UT as the set of negative and positive psychological responses—cognitive, emotional, and behavioral—provoked by the conscious awareness of ignorance about particular aspects of the world. This model synthesizes insights from various disciplines and provides an organizing framework for future research. We discuss how this model can facilitate further empirical and theoretical research to better measure and understand the nature, determinants, and outcomes of UT in health care and other domains of life.
Conclusion
Uncertainty tolerance is an important and complex phenomenon requiring more precise and consistent definition. An integrative definition and conceptual model, intended as a tentative and flexible point of departure for future research, adds needed breadth, specificity, and precision to efforts to conceptualize and measure UT.},

We previously proposed three criteria for applying the term curiosity to animal behavior: (1) the subject is willing to sacrifice reward to obtain information, (2) the information provides no immediate instrumental or strategic benefit, and (3) the amount the subject is willing to pay depends systematically on the amount of information available. In previous work on information-seeking in animals, information generally predicts upcoming rewards, and animals’ decisions may therefore be a byproduct of reinforcement processes. Here we get around this potential confound by taking advantage of macaques’ ability to reason counterfactually (that is, about outcomes that could have occurred had the subject chosen differently). Specifically, macaques sacrificed fluid reward to obtain information about counterfactual outcomes. Moreover, their willingness-to-pay scaled with the information (Shannon entropy) offered by the counter-factual option. These results demonstrate the existence of human-like curiosity in non-human primates according to our criteria, which circumvent several confounds associated with less stringent criteria.},

As a major output for limbic signals, the ventral pallidum was once associated primarily with motor functions rather than regarded as a reward structure in its own right. However, ample evidence now suggests that ventral pallidum function is a major mechanism of reward in the brain. We review data indicating that 1) an intact ventral pallidum is necessary for normal reward and motivation, 2) stimulated activation of ventral pallidum is sufficient to cause reward and motivation enhancements, and 3) activation patterns in ventral pallidum neurons specifically encode reward and motivation signals via phasic bursts of excitation to incentive and hedonic stimuli. We conclude that the ventral pallidum may serve as an important ‘limbic final common pathway’ for mesocorticolimbic processing of many rewards.},

	abstract = {The drive for food is one of the most powerful of human and animal behaviors. Dopamine, a neurotransmitter involved with motivation and reward, its believed to regulate food intake in laboratory animals by modulating its rewarding effects through the nucleus accumbens (NA). Here we assess the involvement of dopamine in “nonhedonic” food motivation in humans. Changes in extracellular dopamine in striatum in response to nonhedonic food stimulation (display of food without consumption) were evaluated in 10 food-deprived subjects (16–20 h) using positron emission tomography (PET) and [11C]raclopride (a D2 receptor radioligand that competes with endogenous dopamine for binding to the receptor). To amplify the dopamine changes we pretreated subjects with methylphenidate (20 mg p.o.), a drug that blocks dopamine transporters (mechanism for removal of extracellular dopamine). Although the food stimulation when preceded by placebo did not increase dopamine or the desire for food, the food stimulation when preceded by methylphenidate (20 mg p.o.) did. The increases in extracellular dopamine were significant in dorsal (P {\textless} 0.005) but not in ventral striatum (area that included NA) and were significantly correlated with the increases in self-reports of hunger and desire for food (P {\textless} 0.01). These results provide the first evidence that dopamine in the dorsal striatum is involved in food motivation in humans that is distinct from its role in regulating reward through the NA. In addition it demonstrates the ability of methylphenidate to amplify weak dopamine signals. Synapse 44:175–180, 2002. © 2002 Wiley-Liss, Inc.},

The authors present a computational sketch for how decisions are made. They take an example of a driver deciding to steer left (L) or right (R) in order to avoid collision with a sudden obstacle.
The driver might consider his current direction (a) of momentum in order to decide. (If he is already moving to the right, it might be easier to steer right). To compute this direction the driver can take into account two streams of sensory evidence: the visual data (I) and the vestibular data (V).
Choice and certainty
Thus, the driver makes a probabilistic inference about which action to take:

P(d{\textbar}I,V)
I would also add a goal here: P(d{\textbar}I,V,g)

where d {\textbackslash}in \{L, R\}. Since this inference is probabilistic it possesses an uncertainty property. This is a posterior over all available choices. The spread of this distribution can be regarded as choice uncertainty (e.g., action uncertainty) which we can also call conflict. Detecting this state increases arousal and inhibition and signals the need for control and the need to attend to sensory (bottom up data).
Achievement and confidence
The driver can also make another probabilistic inference about whether a particular decision is correct:

P(success{\textbar}d,I,V)

Where success {\textbackslash}in \{1, 0\}. This is a distinct probability distribution that is always binary according to the authors. While action uncertainty may be continuous (for continuous actions), achievement uncertainty is always binary.

I guess the weight-update mechanism corresponds to action uncertainty reduction. As the underlying task module gets better, the uncertainty about which decision to make, P(d{\textbar}I,V) decreases. 

Certainty vs confidence
The authors propose that certainty and confidence should be differentiated. Certainty/uncertainty refers to what Meyniel et al. (2015) called distributional uncertainty (more or less). It is the uncertainty of the P(d{\textbar}I,V) posterior -- what decision to make, given the data and prior knowledge. Confidence, on the other hand refers to the degree of belief in the truthfulness of a proposition. The proposition can be anything from "Nigeria is the most populous African country" to "I will score a goal in the next match".
Why confidence?
The authors consider a legitimate question: if a posterior like P(d{\textbar}I,V) can be represented, why do we need to represent limited-summary like confidence?
The authors propose that sometimes, confidence is all that is needed for a task. In other cases, the authors argue that confidence is a way to approximate the posterior P(d{\textbar}I,V)
Distributional certainty can be used to make decisions. That is, if a particular context-input X is perceived, the agent can make judgments about the latent state Y of the environment, e.g., P(Y{\textbar}X).  Y can be discrete (e.g., driver heading to the right vs left) or continuous (e.g., driver is heading y degrees relative to reference point). The probability of Y states is only conditioned on X, so variance of P(Y{\textbar}X) reflects certainty as opposed to confidence. To represent confidence, the agent needs to entertain a particular value (or a range of values) of Y, e.g. P(Y=y{\textbar}X).

I argue that any learner (whether computer or human) must have a built-in hypothesis space in precisely the same sense that Bayesian models have one.

The first step is to summarize the logic of Bayesian inference based on probabilistic models. A discussion is then provided of three recent innovations that make it easier to define and use probabilistic models of complex domains: graphical models, hierarchical Bayesian models, and Markov chain Monte Carlo. The central ideas behind each of these techniques is illustrated by considering a detailed cognitive modeling application, drawn from causal learning, property induction, and language modeling, respectively.},

Here I describe why inferential computations are necessary for perception, and how they go beyond traditional computational approaches based on deductive processes such as feature detection and classiﬁcation. Neural models of perceptual inference rely heavily upon recurrent computation in which information propagates both within and between levels of representation in a bidirectional manner. The inferential framework shifts us away from thinking of ‘receptive ﬁelds’ and ‘tuning’ of individual neurons, and instead toward how populations of neurons interact via horizontal and top-down feedback connections to perform collective computations.},

	abstract = {Curiosity-driven learning is foundational to human cognition. By enabling humans to autonomously decide when and what to learn, curiosity has been argued to be crucial for self-organizing temporally extended learning curricula. However, the mechanisms driving people to set intrinsic goals, when they are free to explore multiple learning activities, are still poorly understood. Computational theories propose different heuristics, including competence measures (e.g., percent correct) and learning progress, that could be used as intrinsic utility functions to efficiently organize exploration. Such intrinsic utilities constitute computationally cheap but smart heuristics to prevent people from laboring in vain on unlearnable activities, while still motivating them to self-challenge on difficult learnable activities. Here, we provide empirical evidence for these ideas by means of a free-choice experimental paradigm and computational modeling. We show that while humans rely on competence information to avoid easy tasks, models that include a learning-progress component provide the best fit to task selection data. These results bridge the research in artificial and biological curiosity, reveal strategies that are used by humans but have not been considered in computational research, and introduce tools for probing how humans become intrinsically motivated to learn and acquire interests and skills on extended time scales.},

One limitation is the lack of studies investigating curiosity as a psychological state that fluctuates over time and with changing contexts rather than only as a trait. Another limitation is the scarcity of behavioral measures of exploration and curiosity.

Here, we show how different types of information-gain emerge when casting behaviour as surprise minimisation. We present two distinct mechanisms for goal-directed exploration that express separable profiles of active sampling to reduce uncertainty. ‘Hidden state’ exploration motivates agents to sample unambiguous observations to accurately infer the (hidden) state of the world. Conversely, ‘model parameter’ exploration, compels agents to sample outcomes associated with high uncertainty, if they are informative for their representation of the task structure. We illustrate the emergence of these types of information-gain, termed active inference and active learning, and show how these forms of exploration induce distinct patterns of ‘Bayes-optimal’ behaviour. Our findings provide a computational framework for understanding how distinct levels of uncertainty systematically affect the exploration-exploitation trade-off in decision-making.},

Initial links were fixed-ratio 1 schedules, and terminal links were equal fixed-time schedules. The duration of the terminal links was varied across conditions. The terminal link on the reliable side always ended in food; the terminal link on the unreliable side ended with food 50\% of the time and otherwise with blackout. Different stimuli present during the 50\% terminal links signaled food or blackout outcomes under signaled conditions but were uncorrelated with outcomes under unsignaled conditions. In signaled conditions, most pigeons displayed a nearly exclusive preference for the 100\% alternative when terminal links were short (5 or 10 s), but with terminal links of 30 s or longer, preference for the 100\% alternative was sharply reduced (often to below .5). In unsignaled conditions, most pigeons showed extreme preference for the 100\% alternative with either short (5 s) or longer (30 s) terminal links. Thus, pigeons' choice between reliable and unreliable reinforcement is influenced by both the signal conditions on the unreliable alternative and the duration of the terminal-link delay. With a long delay and signaled outcomes, many pigeons display a suboptimal tendency to choose the unreliable side.},

Using this procedure, in Experiment 1, we found a relatively modest preference for 100\% over 50\% reinforcement. In Experiment 2, we decreased the reinforcement density for the second initial-link alternative to 75\% and found a significant preference for the 50\% reinforcement initial-link alternative. It may be that this “maladaptive” behavior results from a positive contrast between the expectation of reinforcement correlated with the 50\% reinforcement initial-link alternative and the terminal-link stimulus correlated with 100\% reinforcement. But apparently, the complementary negative contrast does not develop between the expectation of reinforcement correlated with the 50\% reinforcement initial-link alternative and the terminal-link stimulus correlated with 0\% reinforcement that often follow. Such paradoxical choice may account for certain human appetitive risk-taking behavior (e.g., gambling) as well.},

	abstract = {The ability to predict and evaluate reward value, and use that information to develop and execute an action plan efficiently, requires: first, integration of incoming sensory information with reward value, expectation, and memory; second, the incorporation of that information with cognition to develop the plan; and finally, the motor control to execute it. However, the BG are traditionally considered to process information in parallel and segregated functional streams consisting of reward (limbic), associative (cognitive), and motor control circuits (Alexander and Crutcher 1990). Moreover, microcircuits within each region are thought to mediate different aspects of each function (Middleton and Strick 2002). Nonetheless, expressed behaviors are the result of a combination of complex information processing that involves all of frontal cortex. Indeed, appropriate responses to environmental stimuli require continual updating and learning to adjust behaviors according to new data. This requires coordination between sensory, limbic, cognitive, and motor systems. While the anatomical pathways are generally topographic from cortex through BG circuits, a large body of growing evidence supports a dual processing system. Thus, information is not only processed in parallel streams, but also through integrative mechanisms through which information can be transferred between functional circuits (Bar-Gad et al. 2000; Belin and Everitt 2008; Bevan, Clarke, and Bolam 1997; Draganski et al. 2008; Haber et al. 2006; Haber, Fudge, and McFarland 2000; Kolomiets et al. 2001; McFarland and Haber 2002b; Mena-Segovia et al. 2005; Percheron and Filion 1991). This chapter will first discuss the place of the reward circuit in the BG; second, how the sensory systems interface within this circuit; and third, the anatomical basis for integrating the reward circuit with cognition and motor control systems.},

	abstract = {Novelty and surprise play significant roles in animal behavior and in attempts to understand the neural mechanisms underlying it. They also play important roles in technology, where detecting observations that are novel or surprising is central to many applications, such as medical diagnosis, text processing, surveillance, and security. Theories of motivation, particularly of intrinsic motivation, place novelty and surprise among the primary factors that arouse interest, motivate exploratory or avoidance behavior, and drive learning. In many of these studies, novelty and surprise are not distinguished from one another: the words are used more-or-less interchangeably. However, while undeniably closely related, novelty and surprise are very different. The purpose of this article is first to highlight the differences between novelty and surprise and to discuss how they are related by presenting an extensive review of mathematical and computational proposals related to them, and then to explore the implications of this for understanding behavioral and neuroscience data. We argue that opportunities for improved understanding of behavior and its neural basis are likely being missed by failing to distinguish between novelty and surprise.},
