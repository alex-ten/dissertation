# Chapter 1: Introduction
## 1.1. Curiosity is all the rage
* We are riding another wave of curiosity research in psychology, now with added impetus from neuroscience and AI (the first "wave" was in the early 1990s)
* Engineering curiosity for artificial intelligence
    * Much of AI/ML is about engineering.
    * Naturally, M produces a plethora of formalized mechanisms, biologically plausible and otherwise
    * As engineers, AI scientists get to define problems and set constraints first (e.g., how should an agent learn autonomously in the absence of extrinsic rewards) and propose solutions after
* Biological intelligence (BI) researchers work on problems that are unknown: problems that nature solves through evolution[^1]
    * In BI, paradigm shifts (Thomas Kuhn, 1962) take decades.
    * It took BI scientists several decades (what, 70 years?) to start the transition to the 2nd phase. (I think we might beat the 2nd phase or maybe transitioning to it).
    * We are starting to converge on common approaches and views on biological curiosity (Kidd & Hayden; Murayama et al., 2019)
* Many faces of curiosity across different fields
    * Psychology
        * As intrinsic motivation (a drive for psychological needs like competence and agency; Ryan & Deci, SDT)
        * As personality trait (Todd Kashdan) 
        * As cognitive state
          * Aversive or pleasant (van Lieshout review)
          * Knowledge gap (Loewenstein)
          * Information-deprivation (Kidd & Hayden)
    * Neuroscience
        * As attention (beacon for information-sampling; Gottlieb & Oudeyer)
        * As modulator of learning (Kang; Gruber)
    * Development:
        * As solution to explore-exploit tensions (Gopnik)
        * As play (playful exploration in an infinite search space; Chu & Schulz)
    * AI/ML
        * A key for continual learning
* Summary and working definition
## 1.2. From A to B: advantages of AI to BI
* AI offers more precise constructs
* It is important to have precise constructs (see Elliot and Ryder; cf Kidd et al.)
* AI offers formal algorithmic mechanisms
* AI offers evaluations of different mechanisms under simulated conditions (see Wilson et al. on importance of simulations in computational modeling)

# Chapter 2: state of the art in psychology
A critical review chapter on human curiosity. This chapter should provide a very brief (ideally in 1 maybe 2 paragraphs) historical overview of curiosity. The idea is to briefly and broadly review past views on curiosity (including Kidd and Hayden) to *inductively* pull out various ontological categories into which curiosity has been put. By ontological category I mean the core noun for what curiosity is. Off the top of my head, curiosity has been conceptualized as "biological drive", as "phenomenological/neurochemical state", "personality trait". 

Perhaps, there aren't really different categories. Perhaps people have been focusing on several aspects of curiosity. This is reminiscent of the "parable of the blind men and an elephant", but I don't want to call researchers "blind men". However, to a fresh Ph.D. student it may seem like there is no agreement as to what the overall subject of study is. In my view that I share with Murayama, curiosity can describe various aspects of the general knowledge-acquisition process. 


## 2.1. Brief history
* A **very brief** historical overview (like in Bazhydai, Twomney, Westermann, or Oudeyer & Kaplan - in search of neural circuits)
## 2.2. Contemporary views of curiosity
Similar to "many faces of curiosity" section in chapter 1, but more detailed
## 2.3. Setting the stage for the next 3 chapters
The plan here is to lay out the motivation for
1. Studying curiosity in naturalistic contexts of time-extended learning
    * Important to understand how curiosity directs autonomous learning across time
2. Studying metacognitive mechanisms
    * Cite Ryan and Deci's book (they argue that studying motivation on the psychological level is important)
    * Studies by Desender et al. (confidence determines information seeking) / Metcalfe & Kornell (JOLs predict information seeking)
    * Main point is that subjective feelings of curiosity (knowing / progress) drive information seeking
3. Studying goal generation
    * Chu & Schulz, 2020; Coenen, Nelson, & Gureckis et al. (2019)
        * Children set arbitrary goals for hindsight learning
        * We don't know how goals are generated
        * More importantly: we don't study how goals are generated!

# Chapter 3: Artificial curiosity: Diversity of mechanisms and functions
* This chapter will be based on the Cambridge Volume chapter, pretty much as is
# Chapter 4: Time-extended curiosity
## 4.1. Monster paper NatCom and CogSci + interim discussions
## 4.2. Additional simulations
## 4.3. Extended discussion
# Chapter 5: Metacognition
## 5.1. Introduction and motivation
* We want to understand the nature progress representation (e.g., subjective feelings of improvement)
* What's behind subjective judgments of progress?
* How does time modulate subjective judgments of progress?
* Are subjective judgments of progress related to motivation?
## 5.2. Experiment and results
## 5.3. Discussion
# Chapter 6: Exploring Goals
## 6.1. Goals in psychology
* Elliot & Ryder (definition of goals)
* Needs, drives and life-long goals
    * Here, I want to discuss how life-long goals and basic needs related to explicitly represented goals in goal-directed learning
* Sheldon, Jose, Kashdan, & Aaron (goal-progress and well-being)
* Chu & Schulz (arbitrary utility functions)
    * Not so arbitrary (i.e. goals are not random, even in children!)
## 6.2. Goals in AI
* IMGEP framework to help us map out the basic process
* IMGEP can help us generate a roadmap for studying goal-based learning
* Kickstarting goal-exploration research
    * IMGEP process (generation, selection, pursuit)
    * What we know from AI
        * Goal exploration vs action exploration in different settings
        * Carving up the goal space is non-trivial
        * When random goal selection works and when it fails
        * What AI agents do when random goal exploration does not work
        * Is random goal exploration viable for humans?
            * I feel like it cannot be, because we have other things to do

# Chapter 7: Conclusion


[^1]: Something is icky with this problem-solving metaphor. Teleological stance is not necessarily wrong in the context of evolution (https://evolution-outreach.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12052-019-0116-z), but somehow it feels wrong to say that nature solves problems.
