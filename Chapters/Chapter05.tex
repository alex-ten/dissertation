"Reconceptualizing novelty, complexity, and ambiguity in terms of metamemory rather than stimulus features has broken new ground in the study of curiosityâ€™s determinants (e.g., Metcalfe et al., 2017), and helped guide new work on the underlying reward mechanisms involved in curiosity based on the methods of contemporary affective neuroscience (e.g., Gruber et al., 2014)" (Litman, 2019, p. 433).
